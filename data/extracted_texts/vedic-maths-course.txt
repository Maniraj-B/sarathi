So lets get started. I am not going into the details of vedas ( I am sure you 
are not interested in them either). We are going to begin with my favorite 
number 5 and how things get easy with it. 
Fun with Number 5 
Rules: This is normally used for multiplication and in this case both the units 
in digit i.e. the last numbers are 5. Also, the beginning numbers are same. 
You will understand this as you see some examples. 
25 x 25 = 6 | 25 (This one's easy, right?) 
Explanation: As you see both the ending numbers are 5 and also they are 
beginning with 2. So we have satisfied both the rules. Now how do we get 
625. The first step is that you write down 25 on the right hand side. Why we 
do so? Do not think about that. Just write 25 on the right hand side. Then 
we take the number on the left hand side (of 25), in this case 2. And we 
multiply it with the next higher digit number i.e. 3. Therefore we get the 
answer 2 x 3 = 6, which we write down on the right hand side. So we finally 
get the answer as 625. 
45 x 45 = 20 | 25 
Explanation: As this one satisfies the rule too. Both the left numbers are 
same - 4, and the ending numbers are 5. So without thinking the first thing 
we do is write 25 on the right hand side. Then we take the left hand number 
4 and multiply it with 5, hence we get 4 x 5 = 20 (the left side of our 
answer).

135 x 135 = 182 | 25 (slightly tough) 
Explanation: Both the rule has been satisfied. We write down 25 on the right 
hand side. We multiple 13 with the next higher number and get 13 x 14 = 
182. And there we have our answer 18225. Easy right? 
Slight Modification to the Number 5 method 
Rule: The ending number should add up to 10. Infact in the above case too 
the ending number 5 + 5 added upto 10. And the left hand side number 
should be same. This is very similar, so lets look at some example. 
23 x 27 = 6 | 21 (I am sure that,not everyone finds this simple). 
Explanation: Ending numbers 3 + 7 add upto 10. So the first rule is 
satisfied. And both the number on left hand side are same i.e. 2. First thing 
you do is, you multiply 3 x 7 = 21. And then like earlier you multiply 2 with 
the next higher digit number i.e. 3. And we get 2 x 3 = 6 on the left hand 
side. Final answer is 621. 
62 x 68 = 42 | 16 
Explanation: Both the rule have been satisfied. We multiply 8 x 2 as the add 
upto 10 and we get the left hand side of the answer 16. Then we multiply 6 
with the next higher digit number 7 and get 6 x 7 = 42 
Fun with number 11 
Now we try the tricks which can make calculation by 11 easy. We 
will also learn how to multiply by 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, etc. As it is 
nothing but 11 x 2, 11 x 3, 11 x 4, 11 x 5, 11 x 6 respectively.  
Steps involved:  
1. To multiply a number by 11 put a 0 in the beginning and at the 
end of the number.  
2. Starting from the digit’s place add two consecutive digit. 
Remember to go from right to left.  
Examples 
342 x 11 = 03420 = 0+3 /4 + 3/2 + 4/0 + 2 = 3762 
Explanation: We added 0 at the end and the beginning of 342 and got 
03420. Now, as you see we broke the number by taking each consecutive 
number and added them. The first part is 0 + 2 = 2, the first number of our 
answer, then we took 2+4 and got 6, second number of our answer and so 
on.

4932 x 11 = 049320 = 0 + 4/4 + 9/3 +9/3 + 2/0+2 = 54252 
Explanation: In this case when we add 3 + 9 we write down 2 and carry 
forward 1, we again get 4 + 9 + 1 we write down 4 and carry forward 1. We 
add 4 + 1 and get 5 
In the above case if we need to multiply by 22. Then we first multiply by 2 
and then by 11. 
312 x 22 = 624 (312 x2) x 11 = 06240 = 0 +6/6 + 2/4 + 2/0 + 4 = 
6864 
Explanation: Here we are trying to multiply with 22. Hence we first multiply 
the main number with 312 with 2 and get 312 x 2 = 624. And then multiply 
the same number with 22. Rest of the steps remain the same. 
312 x 22 = 03120 x 11 x 2 = (0+3 / 3 + 1 /2 + 1 /0 + 2) x 2 = 3432 
x 2 = 6864 
Explanation: This is the exact same sum as above. In this case you multiply 
the end answer by 2 and get the exact same answer. 
Similarly we can calculate any number into any multiple of 11. Even 
11 x 11. We just repeat the process twice. 
Depending on your age and your ease with numbers you might have found 
this lesson simple or slightly tough. But remember one thing, these kinds of 
calculation has to be done mentally. So get to some practice today as in 4 
days you have a test. I have personally found that once you practice this 
even for 10 mins in a week, you will get used to this. 
I hope this lesson was fun and you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it 
down for you! 
See you tomorrow.

999999999 = 948224242 | 051775757 
Explanation: Wow! I can beat the calculator. Most of the calculator cannot perform 
calculation more than 12 digits and I doubt even your mobile phones can do that. Here 
is how its done, we subtract 1 from 948224243 and get 948224242 . Then we subtract 9 
- 9 get 0, then 9 - 4 = 5, then 9 - 8 and so on. I am sure by now you get the idea. 
But now here is the question what if the number of 9's are more than the number which 
we going to multiply, for example,  
273 x 99999 ( we cannot do this as of now)

Part B (Original number is less then the number of 9's, for example 234 x 99999) 
Rules: Similar to above method, but just imagine 0's in front of the original number. But 
make sure the number of 9's are more and not less or equal.) 
383 x 9999 will become 0383 x 9999 = 0382 | 9617 
Explanation:It is simple, we imagine the number to be 0383. Subtract one from it and 
get 0382. Then as usual we calculate 9 - 0 = 9, then 9 - 3 = 6 and so one. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Welcome to Day 2 
I hope you enjoyed the last lesson and understand how learning vedic math's can make 
calculations fun and easy. Today we will start learning to have fun calculation with 
number 9. I still remember the trick taught to me by my school professor. While doing 
the tables for 9, the ten's digit or left part increased by 1 and units digit or right part 
decreased by 1. 
For example, 
9 x 2 = 18 
9 x 3 = 27 
9 x 4 = 36 
... 
See there is a simple pattern. But in fact it is much easier. So lets begin.. 
Fun with number 9 
Part A (Original number and the number of 9 is same, for example 234 x 999 but 
we cannot use this method for 234 x 9999 or 234 x 99) 
Rules: As usual there is a left hand part of the answer and the right hand part of the 
answer. When multiplying by 9 we subtract one from the original number and write it 
down on the left hand side. Then we subtract each number on the left hand side from 9 
and write it down on the right hand site (this will become clearer with the examples that 
follow).

234 x 999 = 233 | 766 
Explanation: We subtract one from 234 and write it down on the left hand side i.e 234 - 
1 = 233. Then we take each individual number and subtract that number from 9 in the 
order - left to right. So we subtract 9 - 2 = 7, then we subtract 9 - 3 = 6 and again 9 - 3 = 
6. Hence, we get the right part of our answer i.e 766 
Common Mistake: As you see from the above example we subtract 9 from each 
individual number, but we did so from the left hand side of our answer and not the 
original number. In simple words, we should subtract individually from 233 and not from 
234. This is a common mistake I have found and would advice you to remember this 
crucial point.  
948224243 x 999999999 = 948224242 | 051775757 
Explanation: Wow! I can beat the calculator. Most of the calculator cannot perform 
calculation more than 12 digits and I doubt even your mobile phones can do that. Here 
is how its done, we subtract 1 from 948224243 and get 948224242 . Then we subtract 9 
- 9 get 0, then 9 - 4 = 5, then 9 - 8 and so on. I am sure by now you get the idea. 
But now here is the question what if the number of 9's are more than the number which 
we going to multiply, for example,  
273 x 99999 ( we cannot do this as of now) 
Part B (Original number is less then the number of 9's, for example 234 x 99999) 
Rules: Similar to above method, but just imagine 0's in front of the original number. But 
make sure the number of 9's are more and not less or equal.) 
383 x 9999 will become 0383 x 9999 = 0382 | 9617 
Explanation:It is simple, we imagine the number to be 0383. Subtract one from it and 
get 0382. Then as usual we calculate 9 - 0 = 9, then 9 - 3 = 6 and so one. 
383 x 999999 will become 000383 x 999999 = 000382 | 999617 
Explanation: In this case we had 3 extra 9's. So we imagine 3 extra 0's in front of 383. 
Therefore our first case will be 000383 - 1 = 000382, which becomes the left part of the 
answer. And like before we subtract 9 - 0 and get 9, then again 9 - 0 = 9 and again 9 - 0 
= 9, then 9 - 3 = 6 and so on. 
Part C (Original number is more then the number of 9's, for example 234 x 9, this 
method is tough to undestand so pay close attention to this one) 
Rules:I will directly goto the example in this case, as the rules will confuse you at this 
level. 
14 x 9 = 12 | 6 
Explanation: From the number 14 we choose 1(the number in the ten's digit), increase it 
by 1 i.e. 2 or we add + 1. Subtract that from 14 and we get 12. Next we subtract 4 from 
10 and and get 6 i.e. 10 – 4 = 6. The method is confusing but once a person gets a 
hang of it, it’s pretty easy.

24 x 9 = 21/6 
Explanation: From the number 24 we choose 2(ten's digit); increase it by 1 i.e. 3 or we 
add + 1 (2 + 1). Subtract that from 24 and we get 21 (24 -3). Next we subtract 4 from 10 
and get 6 i.e. 10 – 4 = 6. 
47 x 9 = 42/3 
Steps involved: From the number 47 we choose 4(ten's digit); increase it by 1 i.e. 5. 
Subtract that from 47 and we get 42 (47 - 5). Next we subtract 7 from 10 and get 3 i.e. 
10 – 7 = 3. 
112 x 99 = 110/88 
Steps involved: From the number 112 we choose 1; increase it by 1 i.e. 2 or we can say 
we add + 1 (1 + 1). Subtract that from 112 and we get 110 (112 - 2). Next we subtract 
99 from 12 and then add 1 i.e. 99 – 12 + 1 = 88. 
112 x 9 = 100/8 
Steps involved: From the number 112 we choose 11; increase it by 1 i.e. 12 or we can 
say we add + 1 (11 + 1). Subtract that from 112 and we get 100 (112 - 12). Next we 
subtract 9 from 2 and then add 1 i.e. 9 – 2 + 1 = 8 
I hope this lesson was fun and you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it down for 
you! 
See you tomorrow. 
Welcome To DAY 3 
So we have learned some simple methods of multiplying with 5 , 11 & 9. But that was all 
about scratching the surface. We have much more to cover. Today it might be slightly 
tuff. 
Add & Subtract Method 
Rules: This method is based on selecting a proper base and then using the Vedic 
maths method to calculate. Selecting a proper base is one of the most important things 
in this method, which makes major calculations very simple. See the example of 
different bases and make sure you use your wits to choose a proper base while 
calculation. It works in the following manner. 
9 x 9 
9 – 1 [ We assume the base as 10 ] 
9 – 1

8 /1 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 10. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 10. In this case the 
difference is -1. So we write -1 on the right on side of this number. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case -1 x -1. So we get 1 as the answer. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract -1 from the 
number 9 and then we get the answer as 8. And the final answer as 81. 
9 x 8 [ We assume the base as 10 ] 
9 – 1 
8 – 2 
7 /2 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 10. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 10. In this case the 
difference is -1 & -2. So we write -1 & -2 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case -1 x -2. So we get 2 as the answer. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract -2 from the 
number 9 or we subtract -1 from the number 8 and then we get the answer as 7. And 
the final answer as 72. 
11 x 12 [ We assume the base as 10 ] 
11 + 1 
12 + 2 
13 /2 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 10. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 10. In this case the 
difference is +1 & +2. So we write +1 & +2 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case +1 x +2. So we get 2 as the answer. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would add +2 from the number 
11 or we add +1 from the number 12 and then we get the answer as 13. And the final 
answer as 132. 
It is simple, isn't it? 
91 x 91 [ We assume the base as 100 ] 
91 – 9 
91 – 9 
82/81 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 100. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 100. In this case the 
difference is -9 & -9. So we write -9 & -9 on the right on side of these numbers

respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case -9 x -9. So we get 81 as the answer. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract -9 from the 
number 91 and then we get the answer as 82. And the final answer as 8281. 
Now, we have moved on to higger numbers too. 
You may practice higher numbers like 120 x 102 or 105 x 108. But remember so far our 
base has only been 10 & 100. We will move on to slightly complex task tomorrow 
888 x 998 [ We assume the base as 1000 ] 
888 – 112 
998 – 002 
886/224 
598 x 998 [ We assume the base as 1000 ] 
598 – 402 
998 – 002 
596/804 
PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!! Day 4 will be tough, so please make sure you 
know the above steps properly. This the main reason why I have kept this lesson short 
and sweet. 
I hope this lesson was fun and you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it down for you! 
 
Welcome To DAY 4 
Its time to look at the advanced method for Add/Subtract Method. I hope you are 
prepared and excited. 
Add & Subtract Method 
Rules: This method is based on selecting a proper base and then using the Vedic 
maths method to calculate. Selecting a proper base is one of the most important things 
in this method, which makes major calculations very simple. See the example of 
different bases and make sure you use your wits to choose a proper base while 
calculation. It works in the following manner. 
Importance of choosing the RIGHT BASE. 
 
25 x 98 [ We assume the base as 100 ] 
25 – 75 
98 – 2 
24/50

Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 100. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 100. In this case the 
difference is -2 & -75. So we write -2 & -75 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case -2 x -75. So we get 150 as the 
answer. But since the base is 100 we can only use 2 up to 2 digit and we will carry 
forward 1 to the left hand side 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract -2 from the 
number 25 or we subtract -75 from the number 98 and then we get the answer as 23 
but due to carry forward we add 1 and the answer turns out to be 24. And the final 
answer as 2450. 
So far we have looked at numbers where after addition/subtraction from the base, 
both the numbers were either positive or negative. Now lets consider the other 
way round. 
 
12 x 8 [ We assume the base as 10 ] 
12 + 2 
  8 – 2 
10/-4 = 96 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 10. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 10. In this case the 
difference is +2 & -2. So we write +2 & -2 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case +2 x -2. So we get -4 as the answer. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract -2 from the 
number 12 or we add +2 from the number 8 and then we get the answer as 10. 
However since the we have – 4 on the right hand side we subtract it from the base and -
1 from the left hand side. 
And we get the answer 96 
It is slightly confusing but you will get the hang of it pretty soon. 
108 x 97 [ We assume the base as 100 ] 
108 + 8 
  97 – 3 
105/-24 = 104/76 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 100. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 100. In this case the 
difference is +8 & -3. So we write +8 & -3 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract -3 from the number 108 
or we add +8 from the number 97 and then we get the answer as 105. 
However since  we have – 24 on the right hand side we subtract it from the base and -1 from

the left hand side. 
And we get the answer as 10476 
We have also been using the base such as 10, 100 & 1000. Now, lets try some 
different base. Play close attention to the difference as it will help you master this 
method. 
49 x 49 [ We assume the base as 50 ] 
49 – 1 
49 – 1 
48/01 
24/01 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 50. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 50. In this case the 
difference is -1 & -1. So we write -1 & -1 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case -1 x -1. So we get 1 as the answer. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract -1 from the 
number 49 or we subtract -1 from the number 49 (same thing in this case) and then we 
get the answer as 48. 
But since the base is 50 which is nothing but 100/2. So we divide 48 by 2 
And we get the answer 2401. 
Similar Example: 
46 x 46 [ We assume the base as 50 i.e 100/2 ] 
46 – 4 
46 – 4 
42/16 
21/16 
23 x 23 (BASE AS 20 i.e. 10 x 2) 
23 + 3 
23 + 3 
26/9 
52/9 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 20. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 20. In this case the 
difference is +3 & +3. So we write +3 & +3 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case +3 x +3. So we get 9 as the answer. 
NOTE: We write 9 as the answer and not 09 as the answer because here the base 
is 10 x 2. That means the underlying base still remains 10. And that’s why we just 
write one number on the right hand side i.e. 9 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract +3 from the

number 23 or we add +3 from the number 23 (same thing in this case) and then we get 
the answer as 26. 
But since the base is 20 which is nothing but 10 x 2. So we multiply the base 26  x 2. 
And we get the answer 529. 
 
23 x 23 (BASE AS 20 i.e. 100/5) [ Notice the above sum has the same numbers] 
23 + 3 
23 + 3 
26/09 
5.20/09 
5/29 
Steps involved:- 
We select the base as 20. 
Then we check the difference for each number as compared to 20. In this case the 
difference is +3 & +3. So we write +3 & +3 on the right on side of these numbers 
respectively. 
Then we multiply the right hand side. In this case +3 x +3. So we get 9 as the answer. 
NOTE: We write the base as 09 as our basic base or main base is 100/5. The 
whole idea is if the basic base or main base is a multiple or division of 100 then 
we will have 2 digits on the left hand side. And when the basic base of main base 
is a multiple of 10 then we take only one digit on the left hand side, rest we carry 
forward to the left hand side after doing the division. 
Then we do cross addition/subtraction. In this case we would subtract +3 from the 
number 23 or we add +3 from the number 23 (same thing in this case) and then we get 
the answer as 26. 
But since the base is 20 which is nothing but 100/5. So we divide 26 by 5 and get the 
answer 5.20 
Now whenever we get answer in decimal form after division we transfer it to the right 
hand side by adding it. Therefore we add 20 to right hand side and get the answer as 29 
And we get the final answer as 529. 
GOLDEN RULES FOR ADD SUBTRACT METHOD. 
 
Choose the base according to your common sense so that the calculation 
becomes easy. 
If the base is 100 there will be 2 digits on the right hand side, if the base is 10 
there will be 1 digit on the right hand side, if the base is 1000 there will be 3 digits 
on the right hand side and so on. And the extra digit you carry over to the left 
hand side.  
 
Remember to always divide the left hand side or multiply it first, if required. And 
then minus right hand side (if negative) or carry forward from left hand side (if 
positive).

If your answer is something like 24/-26 (with your base being 10). You carry 
forward -2 to the left hand side. Then your answer will be 22/-6. And then you 
subtract. This will give you the answer 21/4. However, you can do it directly too, 
since you know by subtraction of 24 by 3 will give you 21 and you will be able to 
carry 30 to the left hand side and then you will be able to get your answer easily. 
i.e. 30 – 26 = 4. 
 
Welcome to Day 7 
We have already covered a lot and today seems to be one of my favourite 
topics and I am sure you are going to enjoy all the neat tricks I am going to 
teach. Have fun! 
Let’s learn square using the add and subtract method. 
                         
In this method we again choose a base. This method is nothing but 
the above method in a more simplified manner for calculating 
squares. 
             
7 x 7 = (7-3)/3 x 3 = 4/9 
By subtract and add method. Taking the base 10 
            7 – 3 
          7 – 3 
          (7-3)/ (-3 x -3) = 49 
 
Look at the following examples 
12 x 12 = (12 + 2)/2 x 2 = 14/ 4 
14 x 14 = (14 + 4)/4 x 4 = 18/16 = 19/6 (remember the base is 10) 
91 x 91 = (91 – 9)/9 x 9 = 82/81 
95 x 95 = (95 – 5)/5 x 5 = 90/25 
108 x 108 = (108 + 8)/8 x 8 =116/64 
988 x 988 = (988 – 12)/12 x 12 = 976/144 (The base is 1000. Therefore we 
do not need to carry 1 of 144 on the left hand side. 
45 x 45 = (45 – 5)/5 x 5= 40/25 = 20/25 (The base is taken as 50 (100/2). 
Therefore divide by 40 by 2)

45 x 45 = (45 – 5)/5 x 5 = 40/25 = 200/25 = 202/5 (The base is taken as 
50 (10 x 5). Therefore we multiply 40 x 5 = 200 and the carry forward 2 
from left hand side to right hand side as the base is 10) 
Squares using the formula:  
(a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2 
(a - b) (a - b) = a2 - 2ab + b2 
This is simple enough to understand.  
97 x 97 = (100 -3)(100-3) = 10000 – 600 + 9 
108 x 108 = (100 + 8) (100 + 8) = 10000 + 1600 + 64 
29 x 29 = (30 – 1) (30 – 1) = 900 -60 + 1 = 841 
49 x 49 = (50 -1) (50 – 1) = 2500 – 100 + 1 = 2401 
78 x 78 = (80 – 2) (80 – 2) = 6400 – 320 + 4 = 6084 
Let’s try a different method to find squares now: 
Method: 
1. Square the units digit.  
2. Tens digit x units digit x 2  
3. Square of tens digit  
Examples 
42 x 42 = 16/16/4 = 1764 (we carry forward 1 from the centre calculation 
to the left hand side) 
Method: 
1. Square the units digit. We get 4  
2. Tens digit x units digit x 2. We get 16  
3. Square of tens digit is 16.  
23 x 23 = 4/12/9 = 5/2/9 (we carry forward 1 from the centre calculation to 
the left hand side) 
Method: 
1. Square the units digit - 9

2. Tens digit x units digit x 2 - 12  
3. Square of tens digit - 4  
  
62 x 62 = 36/24/4=38/4/4 
Method: 
1. Square the units digit - 4  
2. Tens digit x units digit x 2 - 24  
3. Square of tens digit – 36  
73 x 73 = 49/42/9 =53/2/9 
26 x 26 = 4/24/36= 6/7/6 
(We carry forward 3 to 24. That makes it 27. We put down 7 and carry 
forward to the left 2. Thus we get 6 on the extreme left. And our answer is 
676) 
34 x 34 = 9 / 24 / 16 = 1156 
42 x 42 = 16/16/4 = 1764 
63 x 63 = 36/36/9 = 3969 
 
We learned 3 different ways to find out square. Choose the one you think 
was  
Welcome To DAY 6 
I hope you felt proud yesterday after solving the test and are much more confident right 
now. Maths is simple, isn't it? 
Basic Multiplication But Mentally and Faster. 
The reason we are learning this method is because it is not possible to do all calculation 
using the add and subtract method. There are many other methods involved but this is 
simple and easy. 
Rules: This method simplifies our normal method of multiplication. Just remember the

following diagram when you multiplying 2 digit number with a 2 digit number. 
 
Conventional Calculation 
    54 
 x 84 
  216 
4320 
4536 
By simply Calculation 
    54 
 x 84 
40/52/16 
40/53/6 
45/3/6 
Steps involved: 
We follow conventional method but we try to skip the extra work to reduce time and 
effort.  
First we multiply the right hand side number 4 x 4 (straight line). Write down 16 as our 
answer 
Then we multiply 5 x 4 and add it with 8 x 4 i.e. 5 x 4 + 8 x 4 (the cross). We get 52 as 
our answer. 
Then we multiply the left hand side number 5 x 8 (straight line). Write down 40 as our 
answer. 
Then we carry forward 1 from 16 to the left hand side as we will have only one digit. So 
we get 53 in the centre. 
Then we carry forward 5 from 53 to the left hand side as we again will have only one 
digit in the centre. So we get 3 in centre and on the left hand side we get the answer 45 
Our final answer is 4536 
    27 
 x 35 
6/31/35 
6/34/5 
9/4/5 
Steps involved: 
First we multiply the right hand side number 5 x 7 (straight line). Write down 35 as our 
answer 
Then we multiply 5 x 2 and add it with 3 x 7 i.e. 5 x 2 + 3 x 7 (the cross). We get 31 as 
our answer.

Then we multiply the left hand side number 2 x 3 (straight line). Write down 6 as our 
answer. 
Then we carry forward 3 from 35 to the left hand side as we will have only one digit. So 
we get 34 in the centre. 
Then we carry forward 3 from 34 to the left hand side as we again will have only one 
digit in the centre. So we get 4 in centre and on the left hand side we get the answer 9. 
Our final answer is 945. 
    67 
 x  4 
This is 
    67 
 x 04 
0/24/28 
0/26/8 
2/6/8 
Steps involved: 
First we multiply the right hand side number 7 x 4 (straight line). Write down 28 as our 
answer 
Then we multiply 4 x 6 and add it with 0 x 7 i.e. 5 x 2 + 0 x 7 (the cross). We get 24 as 
our answer. 
Then we multiply the left hand side number 6 x 0 (straight line). Write down 0 as our 
answer. 
Then we carry forward 2 from 28 to the left hand side as we will have only one digit. So 
we get 26 in the centre. 
Then we carry forward 2 from 26 to the left hand side as we again will have only one 
digit in the centre. So we get 6 in centre and on the left hand side we get the answer 2. 
Our final answer is 268. 
Now, if we want to multiply a 3 digit number with a 3 digit number we keep in 
mind the following diagram. 
 
 
 
   342 
x 425 
12/22/31/24/10 
12/22/31/25/0 
12/22/33/5/0

12/25/3/5/0 
14/5/3/5/0 
Steps involved: 
1. First we multiply the right hand side number 2 x 5 (straight line). Write down 10 
as our answer  
2. Then we multiply 4 x 5 and add it with 2 x 2 i.e. 4 x 5 + 2 x 2 (the first cross). We 
get 24 as our answer.  
3. Next we multiple 3 x 5 add it to 4 x 2 and again add that to 4 x 2 i.e. 3 x 5 + 4 x 2 
+ 4 x 2 (the star). And we get the answer 31.  
4. Then we multiply 3 x 2 and add it with 4 x 4 i.e. 3 x 2 + 4 x 4 (the second cross). 
We get 22 as our answer.  
5. Then we multiply the left hand side number 3 x 4 (straight line). Write down 12 as 
our answer.  
6. Then we carry forward 1 from 10 to the left hand side as we will have only one 
digit.  
-     We keep carrying on each number to the left hand side and we leave one number in 
each case and hence we get the number 14/5/3/5/0 
1. Our final answer is 145350.  
   862 
x  35 
we can add a 0 to 35 and then solve as following 
   862 
x 035 
0/24/58/36/10 
0/24/58/37/0 
0/24/61/7/0 
0/30/1/7/0 
3/0/1/7/0 
Steps involved: 
1. First we multiply the right hand side number 2 x 5 (straight line). Write down 10 
as our answer  
2. Then we multiply 6 x 5 and add it with 3 x 2 i.e. 6 x 5 + 3 x 2 (the first cross). We 
get 36 as our answer.  
3. Next we multiple 8 x 5 add it to 0 x 2 and again add that to 6 x 3 i.e. 8 x 5 + 0 x 2 
+ 6 x 3 (the star). And we get the answer 58.  
4. Then we multiply 3 x 8 and add it with 0 x 6 i.e. 3 x 8 + 0 x 6 (the second cross). 
We get 24 as our answer.

5. Then we multiply the left hand side number 8 x 0 (straight line). Write down 0 as 
our answer.  
6. Then we carry forward 1 from 10 to the left hand side as we will have only one 
digit.  
-     We keep carrying on each number to the left hand side and we leave one number in 
each case and hence we get the number 3/0/1/7/0 
Our final answer is 30170.  
Welcome to Day 7 
We have already covered a lot and today seems to be one of my favourite 
topics and I am sure you are going to enjoy all the neat tricks I am going to 
teach. Have fun! 
Let’s learn square using the add and subtract method. 
                         
In this method we again choose a base. This method is nothing but 
the above method in a more simplified manner for calculating 
squares. 
             
7 x 7 = (7-3)/3 x 3 = 4/9 
By subtract and add method. Taking the base 10 
            7 – 3 
          7 – 3 
          (7-3)/ (-3 x -3) = 49 
 
Look at the following examples 
12 x 12 = (12 + 2)/2 x 2 = 14/ 4 
14 x 14 = (14 + 4)/4 x 4 = 18/16 = 19/6 (remember the base is 10) 
91 x 91 = (91 – 9)/9 x 9 = 82/81 
95 x 95 = (95 – 5)/5 x 5 = 90/25 
108 x 108 = (108 + 8)/8 x 8 =116/64 
988 x 988 = (988 – 12)/12 x 12 = 976/144 (The base is 1000. Therefore we 
do not need to carry 1 of 144 on the left hand side.

45 x 45 = (45 – 5)/5 x 5= 40/25 = 20/25 (The base is taken as 50 (100/2). 
Therefore divide by 40 by 2) 
45 x 45 = (45 – 5)/5 x 5 = 40/25 = 200/25 = 202/5 (The base is taken as 
50 (10 x 5). Therefore we multiply 40 x 5 = 200 and the carry forward 2 
from left hand side to right hand side as the base is 10) 
Squares using the formula:  
(a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2 
(a - b) (a - b) = a2 - 2ab + b2 
This is simple enough to understand.  
97 x 97 = (100 -3)(100-3) = 10000 – 600 + 9 
108 x 108 = (100 + 8) (100 + 8) = 10000 + 1600 + 64 
29 x 29 = (30 – 1) (30 – 1) = 900 -60 + 1 = 841 
49 x 49 = (50 -1) (50 – 1) = 2500 – 100 + 1 = 2401 
78 x 78 = (80 – 2) (80 – 2) = 6400 – 320 + 4 = 6084 
Let’s try a different method to find squares now: 
Method: 
1. Square the units digit.  
2. Tens digit x units digit x 2  
3. Square of tens digit  
Examples 
42 x 42 = 16/16/4 = 1764 (we carry forward 1 from the centre calculation 
to the left hand side) 
Method: 
1. Square the units digit. We get 4  
2. Tens digit x units digit x 2. We get 16  
3. Square of tens digit is 16.  
23 x 23 = 4/12/9 = 5/2/9 (we carry forward 1 from the centre calculation to 
the left hand side)

Method: 
1. Square the units digit - 9  
2. Tens digit x units digit x 2 - 12  
3. Square of tens digit - 4  
  
62 x 62 = 36/24/4=38/4/4 
Method: 
1. Square the units digit - 4  
2. Tens digit x units digit x 2 - 24  
3. Square of tens digit – 36  
73 x 73 = 49/42/9 =53/2/9 
26 x 26 = 4/24/36= 6/7/6 
(We carry forward 3 to 24. That makes it 27. We put down 7 and carry 
forward to the left 2. Thus we get 6 on the extreme left. And our answer is 
676) 
34 x 34 = 9 / 24 / 16 = 1156 
42 x 42 = 16/16/4 = 1764 
63 x 63 = 36/36/9 = 3969 
 
Welcome to Day 8 
This topic may be tricky so give close attention to this one. 
We again follow the base system - Not exactly, but depending on the base 
calculation will differ. 
Consider base 10 
Cube for 13 
13 = (13 + 3 x 2)/(9 x 3)/3 x 3 x 3 
     = 19/27/27 (But since the base is 10 only one number will remain in 
each left hand side.

Therefore answer is = 19/29/7 
                            = 21/9/7. 
Steps involved 
1. First we double the excess number from the base 10 and add to the 
original number i.e. 13- 10 = 3. Then 3 x 2(double the excess) + 13 
(original number) = 19  
2. Then we subtract 13 from base, get 3, which we multiply with 9 ( the 
excess number of the left hand side number minus the base i.e. 19 -10 
). So basically - excess from original number from 10 x excess from 
the left number which we got in step 1. We get 3 x 9 = 27.  
3. Then we take the cube of the unit digit of the original number.  
4. And doing the required calculation for the base 10, we get the answer 
2197.  
Cube for 15 
15 = (15 + 5 x 2)/(15x5)/5 x 5 x 5 
     = 25/75/125 
     =25/87/5 
     =33/7/5 
Steps involved 
1. First we double the excess number from the base 10 and add to the 
original number i.e. 15- 10 = 5. Then 5 x 2 + 15 (original number) = 
25  
2. Then we subtract 15 from base, get 5, which we multiply with 15 ( the 
excess number of the left hand side number minus the base i.e. 25 -
10.) So basically, 15 x 5 = 75.  
3. Then we take the cube of the unit digit of the original number.  
4. And doing the required calculation for the base 10, we get the answer 
3375.  
97 = (97 – 2 x 3)/(-3 x -9)/-3 x -3 x -3 
     = 91/27/-27 
     =91/26/73 
Steps involved 
1. First we double the excess number from the base 100 and subtract to 
the original number i.e. 100 - 97 = -3. Then -3 x 2 -3 (original 
number) = -9

2. Then we subtract 97 from base, get -3, which we multiply with -9 ( the 
excess number of the left hand side number minus the base i.e. 100 - 
91.). So basically, -3 x -9 = 27.  
3. Then we take the cube of 100 – 97.  
4. And doing the required calculation for the base 100, we get the answer 
912673.  
In similar manner, 
52 = (52 + 2 x 2)/(2 x 6)/08 
     = 56/12/08 
     = 14/06/08 
104 = (100 + 3 x 4)/3 x 4 x 4/4 x 4 x 4 = 112/48/64 
This may be a tough lesson and with the limitation it is not easy to explain 
this method only through text. But I am sure once you go through the above 
steps a few more time, then you will easily get the hang of this method. So 
good luck and make sure you practice.  
 
Welcome to Day 9 
Finally we have almost reached the end of the learning session as tomorrow 
we will be having a final test. Hope you can recollect all the method or you 
can have a quick glance through all of them. So lets begin with the final 
lesson. 
This is just a introduction to this method and advance method for this has 
not been taught in this lesson. 
Straight Division  
4096/ 64 
4   /  40  9  6 
 6  /      4   1 .    
      6    4     
Answer is 64 
Steps involved

1. First separate the divisor into two parts, write the first number down 
and then above it write the second number. Therefore, we write 6 
down and then 4 above it.  
2. Then we manually check the closest number divisible by 6 from 4096, 
as we would do in our normal division, if we were dividing 4096.  
3. Therefore, we divide 40 by 6; write down the quotient 6 down, and the 
remainder below the next number, in this case we write 4 below 9.  
4. Now, we multiply 4 into our quotient - 6. The 4 we are using is of 64 
or the one which we wrote above 6.  
5. This we subtract from 49 i.e. 49 – 24 = 25  
6. Next we divide 25 by 6 and get our quotient 4, which we write below, 
and remainder below the next number, in this case 1 below 6.  
7. We again repeat the procedure. We multiply 4 with the next quotient 
i.e. 4, therefore 4 x 4 and we subtract it from 16.  
8. We get the answer 0. Therefore our answer is complete which is 64  
996/64 
4 / 9  9  6   
  6 /    3  5  
       1  5 .6 
Answer is 15.6 
 Or 
4 / 9  9  6   
  6 /   3  5  
       1  5 36 
Where 15 is quotient and 36 the remainder. 
Steps involved 
1. First separate the divisor into two parts, write the first number down 
and then above it write the second number. Therefore, we write 6 
down and then 4 above it.  
2. Then we manually check the closest number divisible by 6 from 996, 
as we would do in our normal division, if we were dividing 996.  
3. Therefore, we divide 9 by 6; write down the quotient 1 down, and the 
remainder below the next number, in this case we write 3 below 9.  
4. Now, we multiply 4 into our first quotient - 1. The 4 we are using is of 
64 or the one which we wrote above 6.  
5. This we subtract from 39 i.e. 39 – 4 = 35  
6. Next we divide 35 by 6 and get our quotient 5, which we write below, 
and remainder below the next number, in this case 5 below 6.

7. We again repeat the procedure. We multiply 4 with the next quotient 
i.e. 5, therefore 4 x 5 and we subtract it from 56.  
8. We get the answer 36. Now either we can leave it as it, because this 
will become the remainder. Or we can divide this by 6 to get the 
answer in decimal form. Therefore our answer is complete which is 
15.6  
5100 / 25 
 5 / 3  1    0  0 
  2/    1    2  2 
      1  2   4 . 0 
Therefore we get the answer as 124 
Steps involved 
1. We first divide 3 by 2, get quotient 1, which we write down and carry 
over the remainder 1 below the next number of 3100, which would be 
1  
2. Now we subtract 11 from 5 x 1. Get 6 which we should divide by 2 and 
write down the quotient as 3.  
3. But we don’t do this. Reason being, if we take quotient 3 our 
remainder will be 0 and we won’t be able to continue with the 
calculation.  
4. Therefore, when ever writing down the quotient, we should 
check the next calculation should not give us a answer 0 or 
negative.  
5. Hence, we write down 2 us our quotient and carry forward 2.  
6. Now we again repeat the procedure, 20 - 5 x 2 (quotient) = 10  
7. 10 we divide by 2, since again our next number should not be 00, we 
take the quotient as 4 and write the remainder as 2  
8. And 20 – 5 x 4 = 0  
9. Therefore our answer is 124.  
Remember the last number is always the remainder. If the last 
number is 0 that means it is perfectly divisible. 
80742 / 53 
    3 / 8  0  7  4  2 
    5 /    3  2  2  3   
         1  5 2  3  23 
Therefore our answer is 1523 with the remainder 23 
Steps involved

We first divide 8 by 5 get the quotient 1, which we write down and 
carry the remainder below 0  
o Next we subtract 3 (3 x 1) from 30 = 27  
o Divide 27 by 5, write down the quotient 5 below and the 
remainder 2 below 7.  
o 27 – 15 (3 x 5) = 12  
o We divide 12 by 5, write down the quotient 2 and carry forward 
the remainder 2 below 4.  
o 24 – 6(3 x 2) = 18  
o 18 divide by 5, gives the quotient 3 and the remainder 3.  
o 32 – 9 (3 x 3) = 23, which becomes our remainder.  
 
I hope this lesson
