KATHOPANISHAD
Every
Hindu
knows
the
great
Kuruk-
shetra
scene,
which
forms
the
prologue
of the Bhagavad-Gita-the
warrior,
stricken
by
remorse
and
doubt,
throwing
himself
at the mercy of his divine Charioteer for
guidance.
The
Katha
Upanishad
has
an
equally
sublime introductory
scene, forming
a noble background
for the
great
teaching
imparted in the Upanishad
itself.
Vajasravasa performed an elaborate sacri-
fice, which
terminated
with
a
parting
of
all his possessions as gifts to the guests as-
sembled.
Vajasravasa's
son,
Nachiketas,
watched the proceedings and, as he saw the
gifts being
given, he
was filled with
the
thought of the vanity of it all.
"Of what use is it," he said to himself,
"giving these toothless old cattle and cows past
the age of bearing?
Should not my father, if
he is minded to give what is dear to him, give
me away?"
So he went to his father and said:
"Father!
'Towhom are you going to give me?';
1

His father did not pay heed to the question,
but went on with the routine
of the
great
sacrifice.
Nachiketas
repeated
the
question
again and again till Vajasravasa,
losing pati-
ence, exclaimed without meaning anything like
what he said:
"You?
I shall
give you to
Yama."
Nothing could be uttered on such a solemn
occasion but must be carried out.
The father
was aghast at his own exclamation. Nachiketas,
however, decided to go to Yama.
"Many have
gone before me and many yet must go after
me. I go not alone to Death, and what can
Yama do to me?
Consider what has happened
before this, and consider
what
is going to
happen in the future. Countless are the mortals
that have died before this and will die here-
after.
The life of mortals, indeed, is like that
of the corn which grows and ripens
and is
reaped, and like the grains that
fall which
spring again into life."

(I)-I),
So Nachiketas
went to _Yama.
Yarna was
not prepared
for the voluntary
visitor.
He
was not willing to receive anyone before time.
Nachiketes had to wait for three days before
Yama received him.
A Brahmana
could not
thus
be disregarded
even by Yama.
So, to
make
up for
the
offence, Death
offered
to
Nachiketas whatever
boon he might demand.
He offered many gifts-length
of days, and all
the possessions
of the earth
that
one could
desire, and Swarga thereafter.
But the youth
chose for a boon instruction
at Yama's hands
about the nature of the soul.
"There
is no boon that I desire other than
this knowledge,"
said Nachiketas,
"and there
can be no better
instructor
than you for im-
parting this knowledge.
What use is length of
days and what joy can possessions, or song or-
dance, or horses and chariots
give, so long as
you are there as an ever-present
termination
to-
it all?"

Yama pleaded with Nachiketas:

Even the gods have had doubts
in
the
matter.
The nature of it is so subtle that it is
not possible
to comprehend it satisfactorily.
Choose some other boon, Nachiketas.
Do not
insist; release me from this.

If even the gods had doubts in this matter,
and you say that it is not easily to be compre-

o Death, and what other boon can equal this?
None, indeed.

Nachiketas
was unmoved .. He said:

"Sankaracharya's
interpretation
of m <:rTiIT:

is simply: Keep these ephemeral things for yourself; I
do not care for them.

The first thing that man should learn in the
pursuit of Truth is that the good is something
different from the pleasant.
So Yama begins

These two lead man to very different

Concentrating
the
mind
on
the
Spirit
within, man should realize the divine character
of his own soul and its inherent freedom. The
Spirit
lodged within
oneself is unperceived
because of the perplexities of joy and grief and
attachment
to worldly
objects.
When
one
realizes the divine Spirit within
himself,
all
the confusion of joy and grief disappears.

This realization
can come only
if from
inside one's own heart spring purity of resolve
and earnestness of spirit. It does.not caine by
study or learned discussions. It comes to one
whose Self yearns for realization, and whose
mind has turned away from evil and has learnt
to subdue itself and' to be at peace with the
world.
(2)-23,' 24
In
other
words,
it
comes out
of
the
longing for self-realization that leads to de-
tach~ent,
rather
than from much learning;
that
IS to say, it cotnes out of the grace of the
Supreme Spirit that dwells within Us.
.The Self is other than the changing body.
It ~sother than the fears and the passions that
~:l:ate the mind.
The Soul is divine in origin.

The reader
may note
that
the
following
verses are almost identical with the Gita verses
on the subject, though there is no question here
of inducing Nachiketas to take up arms without
any compunctions of conscience.

The journey of life can be safely completed,
and the Supreme world of Vishnu reached only
if one keeps a watchful control over the senses.
The body is like a chariot to which the senses

are yoked like horses.
The mind is like the
reins, which enable the
charioteer, viz., the
understanding,
to hold the
horses, Le., the
senses, in check. The Soul rides on the chariot,
and the road is the world of objects over which
the senses move.
If the reins are not held
firmly and
wisely, the
senses, like
vicious
horses, will get out of control and the chariot
will not reach the goal, but will go round and
round in births and re-births.
If the man is
~ise, and controls his mind, his senses will be
like good horses driven by a good driver.

The self-existant
Spirit worked its way out
from within and thus the openings of the mind
are directed outwards, inz., the sense organs.
Therefore
do men's thoughts
ever tend out-
wards.
But the few, who have true under-
standing, turn their mind inwards and realize
the Self within.
Those
without

ing,
who
do

fall .into the wide-

what is truly

turn their thoughts to transient
pleasures.

Merely to know is not enough to escape
from the tangle of illusion.
Faith and disci-
pline of life are necessary.
The illusion arises
not so much from ignorance as from attach.
ments.
Enlightenment
comes with
detach-
ment, not with
learning.
This is the
main
teaching to which all the
schools of Hindu
Philosophy ultimately
revert
and on which
they lay the greatest emphasis. The discipline
.and meditation that serve to help the Soul to
detach itself from the things of the world is
what is called Yoga.
