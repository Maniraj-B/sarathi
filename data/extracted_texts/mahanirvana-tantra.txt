Introduction and Preface
PREFACE
THE Indian Tantras, which are numerous, constitute  the Scripture (Shastra) of the Kaliyuga, and as such are
the  voluminous source of present and practical orthodox "Hinduism." The  Tantra Shastra is, in fact, and
whatever be its historical origin, a  development of the Vaidika Karmakanda, promulgated to meet the  needs
of that age. Shiva says: "For the benefit of men of the Kali age,  men bereft of energy and dependent for

existence on the food they eat,  the Kaula doctrine, O auspicious one! is given" (Chap. IX., verse 12).  To the
Tantra we must therefore look if we would understand aright both  ritual, yoga, and sadhana of all kinds, as
also the  general principles of which these practices are but the objective  expression.
Yet of all the forms of Hindu Shastra, the Tantra is that which is  least known and understood, a circumstance
in part due to the  difficulties of its subject−matter and to the fact that the key to much  of its terminology and
method rest with the initiate. The present  translation is, in fact, the first published in Europe of any Indian
Tantra. An inaccurate version rendered in imperfect English was  published in Calcutta by a Bengali editor
some twelve years ago,  preceded by an Introduction which displayed insufficient knowledge in  respect of
what it somewhat quaintly described as "the mystical and  superficially technical passages" of this Tantra. A
desire to attempt  to do it greater justice has in part prompted its selection as the  first for publication. This
Tantra is, further, one which is well known  and esteemed, though perhaps more highly so amongst that
portion of the  Indian public which favours "reformed" Hinduism than amongst some  Tantrikas, to whom, as I
have been told, certain of its provisions  appear to display unnecessary timidity. The former admire it on
account  of its noble exposition of the worship of the Supreme Brahman, and in  the belief that certain of its
passages absolutely discountenance the  orthodox ritual. Nothing can be more mistaken than such belief, even
though it be the fact that "for him who has faith in the root, of what  use are the branches and leaves." This
anyone will discover who reads  the text. It is true that, as Chap. VII., verse 94, says: "In the  purified heart
knowledge of Brahman grows," and Brahmajnane  samutpanne krityakrityang na vidyate. But the statement
assumes the  attainment of Brahmajñana, and this, the Shastra says, can be  attained, not by Vedantic
discussions nor mere prayer, after the manner  of Protestant systems of Christian worship; but by the Sadhana
which is its main subject−matter. I have referred to Protestant  systems, for the Catholic Church possesses an
elaborate ritual and a  sadhana of its own which is in many points strikingly analogous to  the Hindu system.
The section of Tantrikas to whom I have referred are,  I believe, also in error. For the design of this Tantra
appears to be,  whilst conserving commonly−recognized Tantrik principles, to secure  that, as has sometimes
proved to be the case, they are not abused.  Parvvati says (Chap. I., verse 67): "I fear, 0 Lord! that even that
which Thou hast ordained for the good of men will, through them, turn  out for evil." Hitaya yane, karmani
kathitani tvaya prabho  Manyetani mahadeva viparitani manave. It is significant, in  connection with these
observations, to note that this particular Tantra  was chosen as the subject of commentary by Shrimad
Hariharananda  Bharati, the Guru of the celebrated Hindu "reformer," Raja Ram Mohun  Roy.
The Tantra has been assigned to the group of sixty−four known as  those of the Rathakranta. It was first
published by the  Adi−Brahma−Samaja in 1798 Shakabda (A.D. 1876), and was printed in  Bengali characters,
with the notes of the Kulavadhuta Shrimad  Hariharananda Bharati under the editorship of Anandachandra
Vidyavagisha. The preface to this edition stated that three MSS. were  consulted; one belonging to the library
of the Samaja; the second  supplied by Durgadasa Chandhuri, and the third taken from the library  of Raja Ram
Mohun Roy. This text appears to be the basis of subsequent  publications. It was again printed in 1888 by Shri
Krishna Gopala  Bhakta, since when there have been several editions with Bengali  translations, including that
of Shri Prasanna Kumara Shastri. The late  Pandit Jivananda Vidyasagara published an edition in Devanagari
character, with the notes of Hariharananda; and the Venkateshvara Press  at Bombay have issued another in
similar character with a Hindi  translation.
The translation published is that of the first part only. It is  commonly thought (and was so stated by the
author of the Calcutta  edition in English to which I have referred) that the second portion is  lost. This is,
however, not so, though copies of the complete Tantra  are rare enough. The full text exists in manuscript, and
I hope at a  later date to have an opportunity of publishing a translation of it. I  came across a complete
manuscript some two years ago in the possession  of a Nepalese Pandit. He would, however, only permit me
to make a copy  of his manuscript on the condition that the Shatkarmma Mantras  were not published. For, as
he said, virtue not being a condition  precedent for the acquisition of siddhi in such Mantras, their  publication
might enable the evilly disposed to work harm against  others, a crime which, he added, was, in his own
country, where the  Tantra was current, punishable by the civil power. I was unable to  persuade him even with
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

the observation that the mere publication of the  Mantra without knowledge of what is called the
prayoga (which  cannot be learned of books) would in any case be ineffectual. I could  not give an undertaking
which would have involved the publication of a  mutilated text, and the reader must therefore for the present
be  content with a translation of the first part of the Tantra, which is  generally known, and has, as stated, been
several times printed. The  incident has further value than the direct purpose for which I have  told it. There are
some to whom the Tantra, though they may not have  read a line of it, is "nothing but black magic," and all its
followers  are "black magicians." This is of course absurd. In this connection I  cannot avoid interposing the
observation that certain practices are  described in Tantra which, though they are alleged to have the results
described therein, yet exist "for delusion." The true attitude of the  higher Tantrika is illustrated by the action
of the Pandit who, if he  disappointed my expectations, at any rate by his refusal afforded an  answer to these
too general allegations.
The second portion of the manuscript in his possession contained  over double the number of Shlokas to be
found in the first part here  published.
The edition which has been used for the translation is that (now out  of print) edited and published at Calcutta
by Shri Krishna Gopala  Bhakta in Chaitra 1295 Bengali era (April, 1888), with Commentary of  Shrimad
Hariharananda Bharati, and with additional notes by the learned  and lately deceased Pandit Jaganmohana
Tarkalangkara, called Vriddha in  order to distinguish him from another celebrated Pandit of the same  name.
A new edition of the same work is now, in course of publication,  with further notes by the latterÕs son,
Pandit Jnanendranatha  Tantraratna.
This valuable Commentary is not, however, altogether suitable for  the general reader, for it assumes a certain
amount of knowledge on his  part which he does not possess. I have accordingly, whilst availing  myself of its
aid, written my own commentary, and added an Introduction  explaining certain matters and terms referred to
or presupposed by the  text which, as they require a somewhat more extended treatment, could  not be
conveniently dealt with in the footnotes. Some of the matters  there explained are, though common and
fundamental, seldom accurately  defined. Nothing, therefore, is lost by a re−statement of them with an
intention to serve such accuracy. Other matters are of a special  character, and are either not generally known
or are misunderstood. The  Introduction, however, does not profess to be an exhaustive treatment  of that with
which it deals. On the contrary, it is but an extended  note written to help some way towards a better
understanding of the  text by the ordinary reader. For a fuller exposition of general  principles and practice the
interested are referred to three works  which I have in preparation, "Principles of Tantra" (Tantratattva ),
"Exposition of the Secret Worship" (Rahasyapujapaddhati), and  "Description of the Six Centres"
(Shatchakranirupana). There  are, however, some matters in the Shastra or its accompanying  oral tradition
which he must, and if disposed thereto will, find out  for himself. This, too, is implied by the saying in this
Tantra that it  is by merit acquired in previous births that the mind inclines to Kaula  doctrine (Chapter VII.,
verse 99). However this may be, no one will  understand the Shastra who starts his inquiry with a mind
burdened with the current prejudices against it, whatever be the colour  of truth some of them may possess by
reason of actual abuse of Shastric  principles.
In conclusion, I wish to thank my Indian friends for the aid they  have given me in the preparation of this and
other kindred works, and  to whom I am indebted for much information gathered during many  pleasant hours
which we have spent together in the study of a subject  of common interest to them and myself. The Tantras
generally are  written in comparatively simple Sanskrit. For their rendering, however,  a working knowledge of
their terminology and ritual is required, which  can be only fully found in those to whom it is familiar through
race,  upbringing, and environment, and in whom there is still some regard for  their ancient inheritance. As for
others, they must learn to see  through the Indian eye of knowledge until their own have been trained  to its
lines of vision. In this way we shall be in the future spared  some of the ridiculous presentments of Indian
beliefs common in the  past and even now too current.

INTRODUCTION. Mount Kailasa
The scene of the revelation of this Tantra is laid in Himalaya, the  "Abode of Snow," a holy land weighted
with the traditions of the Aryan  race. Here in these lofty uplands, encircled with everlasting snows,  rose the
great mountain of the north, the Sapta Kula Parvata. Hence the  race itself came, and there its early legends
have their setting. There  are still shown at Bhimudiyar the caves where the sons of Pandu and  Draupadi
rested, as did Rama and his faithful wife at the point where  the Kosi joins the Sita in the grove of Asoka trees.
In these mountains  Munis and Rishis lived. Here also is the Kshetra of Shiva  Mahadeva, where His Spouse
Parvvati, the daughter of the Mountain King,  was born, and where Mother Ganges also has her source. From
time  immemorial pilgrims have toiled through these mountains to visit the  three great shrines of Gangotri,
Kedarnath, and Badrinath. At Kangri,  further north, the pilgrims make the parikrama of Mount Kailasa
(Kang Rinpoche), where Shiva is said to dwell. This nobly towering peak  rises to the north−west of the
sacred Mansarowar Lake (Mapham Yum−tso)  from amidst the purple ranges of the lower Kangri Mountains.
The  paradise of Shiva is a summerland of both lasting sunshine and cool  shade, musical with the song of
birds and bright with undying flowers.  The air, scented with the sweet fragrance of Mandara chaplets,
resounds  with the music and song of celestial singers and players. The Mount is  Gana Parvata, thronged with
trains of Spirits (devayoni), of  which the opening Chapter speaks.
And in the regions beyond rises Mount Meru, centre of the  world−lotus. Its heights, peopled with spirits, are
hung with clusters  of stars as with wreaths of Malati flowers. In short, it is written:  "He who thinks of
Himachala, though he should not behold him, is  greater than he who performs all worship in Kashi (Benares).
In a  hundred ages of the Devas I could not tell thee of the glories of  Himachala. As the dew is dried up by the
morning sun, so are the sins  of mankind by the sight of Himachala." 
It is not, however, necessary to go to the Himalayan Kailasa to find  Shiva. He dwells wheresoever his
worshippers, versed in Kulatattva,  abide, and His mystic mount is to be sought in the thousand−petalled  lotus
(sahasrara−padma) in the body of every human jiva,  hence called Shivasthana, to which all, wheresoever
situate, may repair  when they have learned how to achieve the way thither.
Shiva promulgates His teaching in the world below in the works known  as Yamala, Damara, Shiva Sutra, and
in the Tantras which exist in the  form of Dialogues between the Devata and his Shakti, the Devi in Her  form
as Parvvati. According to the Gayatri Tantra, the Deva Ganesha  first preached the Tantra to the Devayoni on
Mount Kailasa,  after he had himself received them from the mouth of Shiva.
After a description of the mountain, the Dialogue opens with a  question from Parvvati in answer to which and
those which succeed it,  Shiva unfolds His doctrine on the subjects with which this particular  Tantra deals.
Shiva and Shakti
That eternal immutable existence which transcends the turiya  and all other states is the unconditioned
Absolute, the supreme Brahman  or Para−brahman, without Prakriti (nishkala) or Her attributes ( nir−guna),
which, as being the inner self and knowing subject, can  never be the object of cognition, and is to be
apprehended only through  yoga by the realization of the Self (atmajñana), which It  is. For as it is said, "Spirit
can alone know Spirit." Being beyond  mind, speech, and without name, the Brahman was called "Tat,"
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

"That," and then "Tat Sat," "That which is." For the sun, moon,  and stars, and all visible things, what are they
but a glimpse of light  caught from "That" (Tat)?
Brahman 
is both nishkala and sakala. Kala is Prakriti.  The nishkala Brahman or Para−brahman is the Tat, when
thought of as without Prakriti (prakriteranya). It is called  sakala when with Prakriti. As the substance of
Prakriti is the  three gunas It is then su−guna, as in the previous state It was  nir−guna. Though in the latter
state It is thought of as without  Shakti, yet (making accommodation to human speech) in It potentially  exists
Shakti, Its power and the whole universe produced by It. To say,  however, that the Shakti exists in the
Brahman is but a form of speech,  since It and Shakti are, in fact, one, and Shakti is eternal ( Anadi−rupa).
She is Brahma−rupa and both vi−guna ( nir−guna) and sa−guna; the Chaitanya−rupini−Devi, who
manifests all bhuta. She is the Ananda−rupini−Devi, by  whom the Brahman manifests Itself, and who, to use
the words of the  Sarada, pervades the universe as does oil the sesamum seed. 
In the beginning the Nishkala Brahman alone existed. In the  beginning there was the One. It willed and
became many. Ahab bahu  syam "may I be many." In such manifestation of Shakti the Brahman  is known as
the lower (apara) or manifested Brahman, who, as the  subject of worship, is meditated upon with attributes.
And, in fact, to  the mind and sense of the embodied spirit (jiva) the Brahman has  body and form. It is
embodied in the forms of all Devas and Devils, and  in the worshipper himself. Its form is that of the universe,
and of all  things and beings therein.
As Shruti says: "He saw" (Sa aikshata, aham bahu  syam prajayeya). "He thought to Himself may I be many."
"Sa  aikshaya" was itself a manifestation of Shakti, the  Para−mapurva−nirvana shakti, or Brahman as Shakti.
From the  Brahman, with Shakti (Para−shakti−maya) issued Nada  (Shiva−Shakti as the "Word" or "Sound" ),
and from Nada, Vindu  appeared. Kalicharana in his commentary on the Shatchakra−nirupana says  that Shiva
and Nirvana Shakti bound by a mayik bond and covering,  should be thought of as existing in the form of
Parang Vindu.
The Sarada says: Sachchidananda vibhavat sakalat parameshvarat  asichchhaktistato nado, nadad
vindu−samudbhavah ("From  Parameshvara vested with the wealth of sachchidananda and with Prakriti
(sakala) issued Shakti; from Shakti came Nada and from Nada was  born Vindu" ). The state of subtle body
which is known as Kama−kala is  the mula of mantra. The term mula−mantratmika,  when applied to the
Devi, refers to this subtle body of Hers known as  the Kama−kala. The Tantra also speaks of three Vindus,
namely  Shiva−maya, Shakti−maya, and Shiva−shakti−maya.
The Parang−vindu is represented as a circle, the centre of which is  the brahma−pada, or place of Brahman,
wherein are  Prakriti−Purusha, the circumference of which is encircling maya.  It is on the crescent of
nirvana−kala, the seventeenth, which is  again in that of ama−kala, the sixteenth digit (referred to in  the text)
of the moon−circle (Chandramandala), which circle is  situate above the Sun−Circle (Suryyamandala), the
Guru  and the hangsah, which are in the pericarp of the  thousand−petalled lotus (sahasrarapadma). Next to
the Vindu is  the fiery Bodhini, or Nibodhika (v. post). The Vindu, with the  Nirvana−kala, Nibodhika, and
Ama−kala, are situated in the  lightning−like inverted triangle known as "A, Ka, Tha ," and which is so called
because at its apex is A; at its right  base is Za; and at its left base Tha. It is made up of  forty−eight letters
(matrika): the sixteen vowels running from  A to Ka; sixteen consonants of the ka−varga  and other groups
running from A to Ka; and the  remaining sixteen from Ka to Tha. Inside are the  remaining letters (matrika),
ha, la(second), and  ksha. As the substance of Devi is matrika (matrika−mayi ) the triangle represents the
"Word" of all that exists. The triangle  is itself encircled by the Chandramandala. The Vindu is  symbolically
described as being like a grain of gram (chanaka),  which under its encircling sheath contains a divided seed.
This  Parang−vindu is Prakriti−Purusha, Shiva−Shakti. It is known as the  Shabda−Brahman (the Sound
Brahman), or Aparabrahman. A polarization of  the two Shiva and Shakti Tattvas then takes place in
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

Parashaktimaya. The Devi becomes Unmukhi. Her face turns  towards Shiva. There is an unfolding which
bursts the encircling shell  of Maya, and creation then takes place by division of Shiva and Shakti  or of
"Hang" and "Sah."  The Sarada says: "The Devataparashaktimaya is again Itself divided, such divisions being
known as Vindu, Vaja,  and Nada. Vindu is of the nature of Nada or Shiva, and Vaja of Shakti,  and Nada has
been said to be the relation of these two by those who are  versed in all the Agamas."  The Sarada says that
before the bursting of  the shell enclosing the brahma−pada, which, together with its  defining circumference,
constitute the Shabda−brahman, an indistinct  sound arose (avyaktatmaravobhavat). This avyaktanada is  both
the first and the last state of Nada, according as it is viewed  from the standpoint of evolution or involution.
For Nada, as  Raghava−bhatta says, exists in three states. In Nada are the guna ( sattva, rajas, and tamas),
which form the substance  of Prakriti, which with Shiva It is. When tamo−guna predominates  Nada is merely
an indistinct or unmanifested (dhvanyat  makoÕ vykta−nadah) sound in the nature of dhvani. In this state,  in
which it is a phase of Avyaktanada, it is called Nibodhika, or  Bodhini. It is Nada when rajoguna is in the
ascendant, when  there is a sound in which there is something like a connected or  combined disposition of the
letters. When the sattva−guna preponderates  Nada assumes the form of Vindu. The action of rajas on
tamas is to veil. Its own independent action effects an arrangement which is  only perfected by the emergence
of the essentially manifesting  sattvika guna set into play by it. Nada, Vindu, and Nibodhika, and  the Shakti,
of which they are the specific manifestation, are said to  be in the form of Sun, Moon, and Fire respectively.
Jñana (spiritual wisdom) is spoken of as fire as it burns up all actions,  and the tamoguna is associated with it.
For when the effect of  cause and effect of action are really known, then action ceases.  Ichchha is the Moon.
The Moon contains the sixteenth digit, the  Ama−kala with its nectar, which neither increases nor decays, and
Ichchha, or will, is the eternal precursor of creation. Kriya is like the Sun, for as the Sun by its light makes all
things visible,  so unless there is action and striving there cannot be realization or  manifestation. As the Gita
sways: "As one Sun makes manifest all the  loka." 
The Shabda−Brahman manifests Itself in a triad of energies  knowledge (jñanashakti), will
(ichchha−shakti), and action (kriya−shakti), associated with the three gunas of Prakriti, tamas, sattva, and
rajas. From the  Parang−Vindu, who is both vindvat−maka and kalatma i.e. , Shakti  issued Raudri, Rudra,
and his Shakti, whose forms are fire ( vahni), and whose activity is knowledge (jñana); Vama, and  Vishnu
and his Shakti, whose form is the sun, and whose activity is  kriya (action): and Jyeshtha and Brahma and his
Shakti, whose form  is the Moon and whose activity is desire. The Vamakeshvara Tantra says  that Tri−pura is
threefold, as Brahma, Vishnu, and Isha; and as the  energies desire, wisdom, and action, the energy of will
when Brahman  would create; the energy of wisdom when She reminds Him, saying "Let  this be thus" ; and
when, thus knowing, He acts, She becomes the energy  of action. The Devi is thus
Ichchha−shakti−jñana−shakti−kriya−shakti−svaru−pini.
Para−shiva exists as a septenary under the form, firstly, of  Shambhu, who is the associate of time
(kala−bandhu). From Him  issues Sada−shiva, Who pervades and manifests all things, and then come  Ishana
and the triad, Rudra, Vishnu, and Brahma, each with their  respective Shakti (without whom they avail
nothing) separately and  particularly associated with the gunas, tamas, sattva and  rajas. Of these Devas, the
last triad, together with Ishana, and  Sada−shiva, are the five Shivas who are collectively known as the
Maha−preta, whose vija is "Hsauh." Of the Maha−preta,  it is said that the last four form the support, and the
fifth the seat,  of the bed on which the Devi is united with Parama−shiva, in the room  of chintamani stone, on
the jewelled island clad with clumps of  kadamba and heavenly trees set in the ocean of Ambrosia.
Shiva is variously addressed in this work as Shambhu, Sada−shiva,  Shankara, Maheshvara, etc., names which
indicate particular states,  qualities, and manifestations of the One in its descent towards the  many; for there
are many Rudras. Thus Sada−shiva indicates the  predominance of the sattva−guna. His names are many,
1,008 being  given in the sixty−ninth chapter of the Shiva Purana, and in the  seventeenth chapter of the
Anushasana Parvan of the Mahabharata.

Shakti is both maya, that by which the Brahman creating the  universe is able to make Itself appear to be
different from what It  really is, and mula−prakriti, or the unmanifested (avyakta ) state of that which, when
manifest, is the universe of name and form.  It is the primary so called "material cause," consisting of the
equipoise of the triad of guna or "qualities" which are  sattva (that which manifests) rajas (that which acts ),
tamas (that which veils and produces inertia). The three  gunas represent Nature as the revelation of spirit,
Nature as the  passage of descent from spirit to matter, or of ascent from matter to  spirit, and Nature as the
dense veil of spirit. The Devi is thus  guna−nidhi ("treasure−house of guna" ). Mula−prakriti is the  womb
into which Brahman casts the seed from which all things are born.  The womb thrills to the movement of the
essentially active rajo−guna . The equilibrium of the triad is destroyed, and the guna, now  in varied
combinations, evolve under the illumination of Shiva (chit ), the universe which is ruled by Maheshvara and
Maheshvari. The dual  principles of Shiva and Shakti, which are in such dual form the product  of the polarity
manifested in Parashakti−maya, pervade the whole  universe, and are present in man in the
Svayambhu−Linga of the  muladhara and the Devi Kundalini, who, in serpent form, encircles  it. The
Shabda−Brahman assumes in the body of man the form of the Devi  Kundalini, and as such is in all
prani (breathing creatures),  and in the shape of letters appears in prose and verse. Kundala means coiled.
Hence Kundalini, whose form is that of a coiled serpent,  means that which is coiled. She is the luminous vital
energy ( jiva−shakti) which manifests as prana, She sleeps in the  muladhara, and has three and a half coils
corresponding in number  with the three and a half vindus of which the Kubjika Tantra  speaks. When after
closing the ears the sound of Her hissing is not  heard death approaches.
From the first avyakta creation issued the second mahat , with its three guna distinctly manifested. Thence
sprung the third  creation ahangkara (selfhood), which is of threefold form  vaikarika, or pure sattvika
ahangkara; the taijasa,  or rajasika ahangkara; and the tamasika, or bhutadika  ahangkara. The latter is the
origin of the subtle essences ( tan−matra) of the Tattvas, ether, air, fire, water, earth,  associated with sound,
touch, sight, taste and smell, and with the  colours  pure transparency, shyama, red, white, and yellow. There is
some difference in the schools as to that which each of the three forms  produces, but from such threefold
form of Ahang−kara issue the  indriya ("senses"), and the Devas Dik, Vata, Arka, Prachetas,  Vahni, Indra,
Upendra, Mitra, and the Ashvins. The vaikarika, taijasa, and bhutadika are the fourth, fifth, and  sixth
creations, which are known as prakrita, or  appertaining to Prakriti. The rest, which are products of these,
such  as the vegetable world with its upward life current, animals with  horizontal life current, and bhuta, preta
and the like,  whose life current tends downward, constitute the vaikrita  creation, the two being known as the
kaumara creation.
The Goddess (Devi) is the great Shakti. She is Maya, for of Her the maya which produces the sangsara is. As
Lord of Maya She is Mahamaya. Devi is a−vidya  (nescience) because She binds and vidya (knowledge)
because She  liberates and destroys the sangsara. She is Prakriti, and as  existing before creation is the Adya
(primordial) Shakti. Devi  is the vachaka−shakti, the manifestation of chit  in Prakriti, and the
vachya−shakti, or Chit  itself. The Atma should be contemplated as Devi. Shakti or Devi  is thus the Brahman
revealed in Its mother aspect (shri−mata) as  Creatrix and Nourisher of the worlds. Kali says of Herself in
Yogini  Tantra "Sachchidananda−rupaham brahmaivaham sphurat−prab−ham."  So the Devi is described
with attributes both of the qualified Brahman;  and (since that Brahman is but the manifestation of the
Absolute) She  is also addressed with epithets, which denote the unconditioned  Brahman. She is the great
Mother (Ambika) sprung from the  sacrificial hearth of the fire of the Grand Consciousness (chit); decked with
the Sun and Moon; Lalita, "She who plays"; whose play  is world−play; whose eyes playing like fish in the
beauteous waters of  her Divine face, open and shut with the appearance and disappearance of  countless
worlds now illuminated by her light now wrapped in her  terrible darkness.
The Devi, as Para−brahman, is beyond all form and guna. The forms of the Mother of the Universe are
threefold. There is first  the Supreme (para) form, of which, as the Vishnu−yamala  says, "none know." There
is next her subtle (sukshma) form, which consists of mantra. But as the mind cannot  easily settle itself upon
that which is formless, She appears as the  subject of contemplation in Her third, or gross (sthula), or physical
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

form, with hands and feet and the like as celebrated in  the Devi−stotra of the Puranas and Tantras. Devi, who
as  Prakriti is the source of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh−vara, has both  male and female forms. But it is in
Her female forms that She is  chiefly contemplated. For though existing in all things, in a peculiar  sense
female beings are parts of Her. The Great Mother, who exists in  the form of all Tantras and all Yantras, is, as
the Lalita says, the  "unsullied treasure−house of beauty" ; the Sapphire Devi, whose slender  waist, bending
beneath the burden of the ripe fruit of her breasts,  swells into jewelled hips heavy with the promise of infinite
maternities.
As the Mahadevi She exists in all forms as Sarasvati, Lakshmi,  Gayatri, Durga, Tripura−sundari,
Anna−purna, and all the Devi who are  avatara of the Brahman.
Devi, as Sati, Uma, Parvvati, and Gauri, is spouse of Shiva. It was  as Sati prior to DakshaÕs sacrifice
(daksha−yajna) that  the Devi manifested Herself to Shiva in the ten celebrated forms known  as the
dasha−mahavidya referred to in the text  Kali, Bagala,  Chhinnamasta, Bhuvaneshvari, Matangini, Shodashi,
Dhumavati,  Tripura−sundari, Tara, and Bhairavi. When, at the Daksha−yajna She  yielded up her life in
shame and sorrow at the treatment accorded by  her father to Her Husband, Shiva took away the body, and,
ever bearing  it with Him, remained wholly distraught and spent with grief. To save  the world from the forces
of evil which arose and grew with the  withdrawal of His Divine control, Vishnu with His discus (chakra) cut
the dead body of Sati, which Shiva bore, into fifty−one  fragments, which fell to earth at the places thereafter
known as the  fifty−one maha−pitha−sthana (referred to in the text), where  Devi, with Her Bhairava, is
worshipped under various names.
Besides the forms of the Devi in the brahmanda there is Her  subtle form called Kundalini in the body
(pindanda). These are but some only of Her endless forms. She is seen as one and  as many, as it were, but
one moon reflected in countless waters. She  exists, too, in all animals and inorganic things, since the universe
with all its beauties is, as the Devi Purana says, but a part of Her.  All this diversity of form is but the infinite
manifestations of the  flowering beauty of the One Supreme Life, a doctrine which is nowhere  else taught with
greater wealth of illustration than in the Shakta  Shastras, and Tantras. The great Bharga in the bright Sun and
all  Devatas, and, indeed, all life and being, are wonderful, and are  worshipful, but only as Her manifestations.
And he who worships them  otherwise is, in the words of the great Devi−bhagavata, "like unto a  man who,
with the light of a clear lamp in his hands, yet falls into  some waterless and terrible well." The highest
worship for which the  sadhaka is qualified (adhikari) only after external  worship and that internal form
known as sadhara, is  described as niradhara. Therein Pure Intelligence is the  Supreme Shakti who is
worshipped as the Very Self, the Witness freed of  the glamour of the manifold Universe. By oneÕs own
direct experience of  Maheshvari as the Self She is with reverence made the object of that  worship which
leads to liberation.
Guna
It cannot be said that current explanations give a clear  understanding of this subject. Yet such is necessary,
both as affording  one of the chief keys to Indian philosophy and to the principles which  govern Sadhana. The
term guna is generally  translated "quality," a word which is only accepted for default of a  better. For it must
not be overlooked that the three guna ( Sattva, rajas, and tamas), which are of  Prakriti, constitute Her very
substance. This being so, all Nature  which issues from Her, the Maha−karana−svarupa., is  called
tri−gunatmaka, and is composed of the same guna  in different states of relation to one another. The functions
of  sattva, rajas, and tamas are to reveal, to  make active, and to suppress respectively. Rajas is the dynamic,
as sattva and tamas are static principles. That is to  say, sattva and tamas can neither reveal nor suppress
without being first rendered active by rajas. These gunas  work by mutual suppression.
The unrevealed Prakriti (avyakta−prakriti) or Devi is  the state of stable equilibrium of these three guna.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Guna
12

When this  state is disturbed the manifested universe appears, in every object of  which one or other of the
three guna is in the ascendant. Thus  in Devas, as in those who approach the divya state, sattva  predominates,
and rajas and tamas are very much reduced.  That is, their independent manifestation is reduced. They are in
one  sense still there, for where rajas is not independently active  it is operating on sattva to suppress
tamas, which  appears or disappears to the extent to which it is, or is not, subject  to suppression by the
revealing principle. In the ordinary human jiva , considered as a class, tamas is less reduced than in  the case
of the Deva, but very much reduced when comparison is made  with the animal jiva. Rajas has great
independent  activity, and sattva is also considerably active. In the animal  creation sattva has considerably
less activity. Rajas has  less independent activity than in man, but is much more active than in  the vegetable
world. Tamas is greatly less preponderant than in  the latter. In the vegetable kingdom tamas is more
preponderant  than in the case of animals, and both rajas and sattva  less so. In the inorganic creation rajas
makes tamas  active to suppress both sattva and its own independent activity.  It will thus be seen that the
"upward" or revealing movement from the  predominance of tamas to that of sattva represents the  spiritual
progress of the jivatma.
Again, as between each member of these classes one or other of the  three guna may be more or less in the
ascendant.
Thus, in one man as compared with another, the sattva guna  may predominate, in which case his
temperament is sattvik, or, as the  Tantra calls it, divyabhava. In another the rajoguna  may prevail, and in the
third the tamoguna, in which case  the individual is described as rajasik, or tamasik, or, to use Tantrik
phraseology, he is said to belong to virabhava, or is a  pashu respectively. Again the vegetable creation is
obviously less  tamasik, and more rajasik and sattvik than the mineral, and even  amongst these last there may
be possibly some which are less tamasik  than others.
Etymologically, sattva is derived from "sat," that  which is eternally existent. The eternally existent is also
chit, pure Intelligence or Spirit, and ananda or Bliss. In a  secondary sense, sat is also used to denote the
"good." And  commonly (though such use obscures the original meaning), the word  sattva guna is rendered
"good quality." It is, however, "good" in  the sense that it is productive of good and happiness. In such case,
however, stress is laid rather on a necessary quality or effect (in the  ethical sense) of "sat" than upon its
original meaning. In the  primary sense sat is that which reveals. Nature is  a revelation of spirit (sat). Where
Nature is such a  revelation of spirit there it manifests as sattva guna. It is the shining forth from under the veil
of the hidden spiritual  substance (sat). And that equality in things which  reveals this is sattva guna. So of a
pregnant woman it is  said that she is antahsattva, or instinct with sattva ; she in whom sattva as jiva (whose
characteristic  guna is sattva) is living in an hidden state.
But Nature not only reveals, but is also a dense covering or veil of  spirit, at times so dense that the ignorant
fail to discern the spirit  which it veils. Where Nature is a veil of spirit there it appears in  its quality of
tamoguna.
In this case the tamoguna is currently spoken of as  representative of inertia, because that is the effect of the
nature  which veils. This quality, again, when translated into the moral  sphere, becomes ignorance, sloth, etc.
In a third sense nature is a bridge between spirit which reveals and  matter which veils. Where Nature is a
bridge of descent from spirit to  matter, or of ascent from matter to spirit, there it manifests itself  as
rajoguna. This is generally referred to as the quality  of activity, and when transferred to the sphere of feeling
it shows  itself as passion. Each thing in Nature then contains that in which  spirit is manifested or reflected as
in a mirror or sattvaguna; that by which spirit is covered, as it were, by a veil of darkness  or tamoguna, and
that which is the vehicle for the  descent into matter or the return to spirit or rajoguna. Thus sattva is the light
of Nature, as tamas is its  shade. Rajas is, as it were, a blended tint oscillating  between each of the extremes
constituted by the other guna.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Guna
13

The object of Tantrik sadhana is to bring out and make  preponderant the sattva guna by the aid of
rajas, which operates to make the former guna active. The subtle body ( lingasharira) of the jivatma
comprises in it buddhi , ahangkara, manas, and the ten senses. This  subtle body creates for itself gross bodies
suited to the spiritual  state of the jivatma. Under the influence of  prarabdhda karmma, buddhi becomes
tamasik, rajasik , or sattvik. In the first case the jivatma  assumes inanimate bodies; in the second, active
passionate bodies; and  in the third, sattvik bodies of varying degrees of spiritual  excellence, ranging from
man to the Deva. The gross body is also  trigunatmaka. This body conveys impressions to the  jivatma through
the subtle body and the buddhi in  particular. When sattva is made active impressions of happiness  result, and
when rajas or tamas are active the  impressions are those of sorrow and delusion. These impressions are the
result of the predominance of these respective guna. The action of  rajas on sattva produces happiness, as its
own independent  activity or operation on tamas produce sorrow and delusion  respectively. Where sattva or
happiness is predominant, there  sorrow and delusion are suppressed. Where rajas or sorrow is  predominant,
there happiness and delusion are suppressed. And where  tamas or delusion predominates there, as in the case
of the  inorganic world, both happiness and sorrow are suppressed. All objects  share these three states in
different proportions. There is, however,  always in the jivatma an admixture of sorrow with happiness, due  to
the operation of rajas. For happiness, which is the  fruit of righteous acts done to attain happiness, is after all
only a  vikara. The natural state of the jivatma  that is,  the state of its own true nature  is that bliss
(ananda) which arises from the pure knowledge of the Self, in which both  happiness and sorrow are equally
objects of indifference. The worldly  enjoyment of a person involves pain to self or others. This is the  result of
the pursuit of happiness, whether by righteous or unrighteous  acts. As spiritual progress is made, the gross
body becomes more and  more refined. In inanimate bodies karma operates to the  production of pure delusion.
On the exhaustion of such karma the  jivatma assumes animate bodies for the operation of such forms of
karma as lead to sorrow and happiness mixed with delusion. In the  vegetable world sattva is but little active,
with a  corresponding lack of discrimination, for discrimination is the effect  of sattva in buddhi, and from
discrimination  arises the recognition of pleasure and pain, conceptions of right and  wrong, of the transitory
and intransitory, and so forth, which are the  fruit of a high degree of discrimination, or of activity of
sattva . In the lower animal sattva in buddhi is not  sufficiently active to lead to any degree of development of
these  conceptions. In man, however, the sattva in buddhi is  considerably active, and in consequence these
conceptions are natural  in him. For this reason the human birth is, for spiritual purposes, so  important. All
men, however, are not capable of forming such  conceptions in an equal degree. The degree of activity in an
individualÕs buddhi depends on his prarabdha karma. However bad such karma may be in any particular
case, the  individual is yet gifted with that amount of discrimination which, if  properly aroused and aided, will
enable him to better his spiritual  condition by inducing the rajoguna in him to give more and more  activity to
the sattva guna in his buddhi.
On this account proper guidance and spiritual direction are  necessary. A good guru, by reason of his own
nature and  spiritual attainment and disinterested wisdom, will both mark out for  the sishya the path which is
proper for him, and aid him to  follow it by the infusion of the tejas which is in the Guru  himself. Whilst
sadhana is, as stated, a process for the  stimulation of the sattva guna, it is evident that one  form of it is not
suitable to all. It must be adapted to the spiritual  condition of the sishya, otherwise it will cause injury  instead
of good. Therefore it is that the adoption of certain forms of  sadhana by persons who are not competent
(adhikari), may not only be fruitless of any good result, but may even lead to  evils which sadhana as a
general principle is designed to  prevent. Therefore also is it said that it is better to follow oneÕs  own dharma
than that, however exalted it be, of another.
The Worlds (Loka)
This earth, which is the object of the physical senses and of the  knowledge based thereon, is but one of
fourteen worlds or regions  placed "above" and "below" it, of which (as the sutra says)  knowledge may be
obtained by meditation on the solar "nerve" (nada ) sushumna in the merudanda. On this nadi  six of the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
The Worlds (Loka)
14

upper worlds are threaded, the seventh and highest  overhanging it in the Sahasrara Padma, the
thousand−petalled lotus. The sphere of earth (Bhurloka), with its continents, their mountains and rivers, and
with its oceans,  is the seventh or lowest of the upper worlds. Beneath it are the Hells  and Nether Worlds, the
names of which are given below. Above the  terrestrial sphere is Bhuvarloka, or the atmospheric  sphere
known as the antariksha, extending "from the earth  to the sun," in which the Siddhas and other celestial
beings ( devayoni) of the upper air dwell. "From the sun to the pole  star" dhruva) is svarloka, or the heavenly
sphere. Heaven (svarga) is that which delights the mind,  as hell (naraka) is that which gives it pain. In the
former is the abode of the Deva and the blest.
These three spheres are the region of the consequences of work, and  are termed transitory as compared with
the three highest spheres, and  the fourth, which is of a mixed character. When the jiva has  received his
reward he is reborn again on earth. For it is not good  action, but the knowledge of the atma which procures
Liberation ( moksha). Above Svarloka is Maharloka, and  above it the three ascending regions known as the
janarloka, tapoloka, and satyaloka, each inhabited by  various forms of celestial intelligence of higher and
higher degree.  Below the earth (Bhuh) and above the nether worlds are  the Hells (commencing with
Avichi), and of which,  according to popular theology, there are thirty−four, though it is  elsewhere said there
are as many hells as there are offences for which  particular punishments are meted out. Of these, six are
known as the  great at hells. Hinduism, however, even when popular, knows nothing of  a hell of eternal
torment. To it nothing is eternal but the Brahman.  Issuing from the Hells the jiva is again reborn to make its
future. Below the Hells are the seven nether worlds, Sutala, Vitala,  Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, Atala, and
Patala, where, according to  the Puranas, dwell the Naga serpent divinities, brilliant with jewels,  and where,
too, the lovely daughters of the Daityas and Danavas wander,  fascinating even the most austere. Yet below
Patala is the form of  Vishnu proceeding from the dark quality (tamogunah), known as the Sesha serpent or
Ananta, bearing the entire world as a  diadem, attended by his Shakti Varuni, his own embodied radiance.
Inhabitants of the Worlds
The worlds are inhabited by countless grades of beings, ranging from  the highest Devas (of whom there are
many classes and degrees) to the  lowest animal life. The scale of beings runs from the shining  manifestations
of Spirit to those in which it is so veiled that it  would seem almost to have disappeared in its material
covering. There  is but one Light, one Spirit, whose manifestations are many. A flame  enclosed in a clear
glass loses but little of its brilliancy. If we  substitute for the glass, paper, or some other more opaque yet
transparent substance, the light is dimmer. A covering of metal may be  so dense as to exclude from sight the
rays of light which yet burns  within with an equal brilliancy. As a fact, all such veiling forms are  maya. They
are none the less true for those who live in and  are themselves part of the mayik world. Deva, or "heavenly
and shining  one"  for spirit is light and self−manifestation  is applicable to  those descending yet high
manifestations of the Brahman, such as the  seven Shivas, including the Trinity (trimurtti), Brahma,  Vishnu,
and Rudra. Devi, again, is the title of the Supreme Mother  Herself, and is again applied to the manifold forms
assumed by the one  only Maya, such as Kali, Sarasvati, Lakshmi, Gauri, Gayatri, Sandhya,  and others. In the
sense also in which it is said, "Verily, in the  beginning there was the Brahman. It created the Devas," the
latter term  also includes lofty intelligencies belonging to the created world  intermediate between Ishvara
(Himself a Purusha) and man,  who in the person of the Brahmana is known as Earth−deva (bhudeva ). These
spirits are of varying degrees. For there are no breaks  in the creation which represents an apparent descent of
the Brahman in  gradually lowered forms. Throughout these forms play the divine  currents of pravritti and
nivritti, the latter  drawing to Itself that which the former has sent forth.
Deva
, jiva and jara (inorganic matter) are, in their  real, as opposed to their phenomenal and illusory, being, the one
Brahman, which appears thus to be other than Itself through its  connection with the upadhi or limiting
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

conditions with which  ignorance (avidya) invests it. Therefore all beings which  are the object of worship are
each of them but the Brahman seen through  the veil of avidya. Though the worshippers of Devas may  not
know it, their worship is in reality the worship of the Brahman,  and hence the Mahanirvana Tantra says that,
"as all streams flow to the  ocean, so the worship given to any Deva is received by the Brahman." On  the other
hand, those who, knowing this, worship the Devas, do so as  manifestations of the Brahman, and thus worship
It mediately. The sun,  the most glorious symbol in the physical world, is the mayik vesture of  Her who is
"clothed with the sun." 
In the lower ranks of the celestial hierarchy are the Devayonis,  some of whom are mentioned in the opening
verses of the first chapter  of the text. The Devas are of two classes: "unborn" (ajata) that is, those which have
not, and those which have (sadhya) evolved from humanity as in the case of King Nahusha, who became
Indra. Opposed to the divine hosts are the Asura, Danava, Daitya,  Rakshasa, who, with other spirits, represent
the tamasik or demonic  element in creation. All Devas, from the highest downwards, are  subordinate to both
time and karma. So it is said,  "Salutation to Karma, over which not even Vidhi (Brahma) prevails"
( Namastat karmmabhyovidhirapi na yebhyah prabhavati). The  rendering of the term "Deva" by "God" has
led to a misapprehension of  Hindu thought. The use of the term "angel" may also mislead, for though  the
world of Devas has in some respects analogy to the angelic choirs,  the Christian conception of these Beings,
their origin and functions,  does not include, but in fact excludes, other ideas connoted by the  Sanskrit term. 
The pitris, or "Fathers," are a creation (according to  some) separate from the predecessors of humanity, and
are, according to  others, the lunar ancestry who are addressed in prayer with the Devas.  From Brahma, who is
known as the "Grandfather" Pita Maha of the human  race, issued Marichi, Atri, and others, his "mental sons":
the  Agnishvattvah, Saumnyah, Havishmantah, Ushmapah, and other classes of  Pitris, numbering, according
to the Markandeya Purana,  thirty−one. Tarpanam, or oblation, is daily offered to  these pitris. The term is also
applied to the human ancestors of the  worshipper generally up to the seventh generation to whom in  shraddha
(the obsequial rites) pinda and water are offered  with the mantra "svadha." 
The Rishi are seers who know, and by their knowledge are the  makers of shastra and "see" all mantras. The
word comes from the  root rish Rishati−prapnoti sarvvang mantrang jnanena pashyati
sangsaraparangva, etc. The seven great Rishi or  saptarshi of the first manvantara are Marichi, Atri,  Angiras,
Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya, and Vashishtha. In other  manvantara there are other sapta−rshi. In the present
manvantara the seven are Kashyapa Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra,  Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja. To the
Rishi the Vedas were  revealed. Vyasa taught the Rigveda so revealed to Paila, the Yajurveda  to
Vaishampayana, the Samaveda to Jaimini, Atharvaveda to Samantu, and  Itihasa and Purana to Suta. The
three chief classes of Rishi  are the Brah−marshi, born of the mind of Brahma, the  Devarshi of lower rank,
and Rajarshi or Kings who became  Rishis through their knowledge and austerities, such as Janaka,  Ritaparna,
etc. Thc Shrutarshi are makers of Shastras, as  Sushruta. The Kandarshi are of the Karmakanda, such as
Jaimini.
The Muni, who may be a Rishi, is a sage. Muni is so  called on account of his mananam (mananat
muniruchyate).  Mananam is that thought, investigation, and discussion which marks  the independent thinking
mind. First there is shravanam listening; then mananam, which is the thinking or  understanding, discussion
upon, and testing of what is heard as opposed  to the mere acceptance on trust of the lower intelligence. There
two  are followed by nididhyasanam, which is attention and profound  meditation on the conclusions
(siddhanta) drawn from what is so  heard and reasoned upon. As the Mahabharata says, "The Veda differ, and
so do the Smriti. No one is a muni who has no independent  opinion of his own (nasau muniryasya matang na
bhinnam).
The human being is called jiva  that is, the embodied Atma  possessed by egoism and of the notion that it
directs the puryashtaka , namely, the five organs of action (karmendriya), the five organs of perception
(jnanendriya), the  fourfold antahkarana or mental self (Manas, Buddhi, Ahangkara, Chitta), the five vital
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

airs (Prana ), the five elements, Kama (desire), Karma (action  and its results), and Avidya (illusion). When
these false  notions are destroyed, the embodiment is destroyed, and the wearer of  the mayik garment attains
nirvana. When the jiva  is absorbed in Brahman, there is no longer any jiva remaining  as such.
Varna
Ordinarily there are four chief divisions or castes (varna) of Hindu society  viz.: Brahmana (priesthood;
teaching);  Kshattriya (warrior); Vaishya (merchant); Shudra  (servile)  said to have sprung respectively from
the mouth, arm, thigh,  and foot of Brahma. A man of the first three classes becomes an  investiture, during the
upanayana ceremony of the sacred thread,  twice−born (dvija). It is said that by birth one is  shudra, by
sangskara (upanayana), dvija  (twice−born); by study of the Vedas one attains the state of a vipra ; and that
he who has knowledge of the Brahman is a Brahmana . The present Tantra, however, speaks of a fifth or
hybrid class  (samanya), resulting from intermixture between the  others. It is a peculiarity of Tantra that its
worship is largely free  of Vaidik exclusiveness, whether based on caste, sex, or otherwise. As  the Gautamiya
Tantra says, "The Tantra is for all men, of whatever  caste, and for all women" (Sarvvavarnadhikaraschcha
narinang yogya  eva cha).
Ashrama
The four stages, conditions, or periods in the life of a Brahman  are: First, that of the chaste student, or
brahmachari; second, the period of secular life as a married householder, or  grihastha; third, that of the
recluse, or vanaprastha, when there is retirement from the world; and lastly, that of the  beggar, or
bhikshu, who begs his single daily meal, and  meditates upon the Supreme Spirit to which he is about to
return. For  the Kshattriya there are the first three Ashramas; for the  Vaishya, the first two; and for the
Shudra, the grihastha Ashrama only. This Tantra states that in the Kali  age there are only two Ashrama. The
second garhasthya and the  last bhikshuka or avadhuta. Neither the conditions  of life, nor the character,
capacity, and powers of the people of this  age allow of the first and third. The two ashramas prescribed  for
the Kali age are open to all castes indiscriminately.
There are, it is now commonly said, two main divisions of  avadhuta  namely, Shaivavadhuta and
Brahmavadhuta of  each of which there are, again, three divisions. Of the first class the  divisions are firstly
Shaivavadhuta, who is apurna  (imperfect). Though an ascetic, he is also a householder and like  Shiva. Hence
his name. The second is the wandering stage of the  Shaiva (or the parivrajaka), who has now left the  world,
and passes his time doing puja, japa, etc.,  visiting the tirtha and pitha, or places of  pilgrimage. In this stage,
which, though higher, is still imperfect,  the avadhuta is competent for ordinary sadhana with a  shakti. The
third is the perfect stage of a Shaiva. Wearing only  the kaupina, he renounces all things and all rites,  though
within certain limits he may practise some yoga, and is permitted to meet the request of a woman who makes
it of him.  Of the second class the three divisions are, firstly, the  Brahma−vadhuta, who, like the
Shaivavadhuta, is imperfect (apurna) and a householder. He is not permitted,  however, to have a Shaiva
Shakti, and is restricted to  sviya−shakti. The second−class Brahma−parivrajaka is similar  to the Shaiva of
the same class, except that ordinarily he is  not permitted to have anything to do with any woman, though he
may,  under the guidance of his Guru, practise yoga  accompanied by Shakti. The third or highest class
Hangsavadhuta  is similar to the third Shaiva degree,  except that he must under no circumstances touch a
woman or metals, nor  may he practise any rites or keep any observances.
Correspondence Between Macrocosm and  Microcosm
The universe consists of a Mahabrahmanda, or grand  Kosmos, and of numerous Brihatbrahmanda, or
macrocosms  evolved from it. As is said by the Nirvana Tantra, all which is in the  first is in the second. In the
latter are heavenly bodies and beings,  which are microcosms reflecting on a minor scale the greater worlds
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Varna

which evolve them. "As above, so below." This mystical maxim of the  West is stated in the Vishvasara
Tantra as follows: "What is here is  elsewhere; what is not here is nowhere" (yadihasti tadanyatra  yannehasti
natatkvachit). The macrocosm has its meru, or vertebral column, extending from top to bottom. There are
fourteen regions descending from Satyaloka, the highest.  These are the seven upper and the seven nether
worlds (vide ante ). The meru of the human body is the spinal column, and  within it are the chakra, in which
the worlds are said to  dwell. In the words of the Shaktananda−Tarangini, they are  pindamadhyesthita. Satya
has been said to be in the  sahasrara, and Tapah, Janah, Mahah, Svah, Bhuvah, Bhuh in the
ajna, vishuddha , anahata, manipura, svadishthana, and  muladhara lotuses respectively. Below muladhara
and in the  joints, sides, anus, and organs of generation are the  nether worlds. The bones near the spinal
column are the kula−parvata . Such are the correspondences as to earth. Then as to water.  The nadi are the
rivers. The seven substances of the body (dhatu ) are the seven islands. Sweat, tears, and the like are the
oceans.  Fire exists in the muladhara, sushumna, navel, and  elsewhere. As the worlds are supported by the
pravahana and  other vayu ("airs"), so is the body supported by the ten vayu  prana, etc. There is the same
akasha (ether) in both.  The witness within is the purusha without, for the personal soul  of the microcosm
corresponds to the cosmic soul (hiranyagarbha) in the macrocosm.
The Ages
The passage of time within a maha−yoga influences for the  worse man and the world in which he lives. This
passage is marked by  the four ages (yuga), called Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and  Kali−yuga, the last being that in
which it is generally supposed the  world now is. The yuga is a fraction of a kalpa, or day of Brahma of
4,320,000 human years. The kalpa is divided  into fourteen manvantara, which are again subdivided into
seventy−one maha.−yuga; the length of each of  which is 4,320,000 human years. The maha−yuga (great
age) is  itself composed of four yuga (ages)  (a) Satya, (b ) Treta, (c) Dvapara, (d) Kali. Official science
teaches  that man appeared on the earth in an imperfect state, from which he has  since been gradually, though
continually, raising himself. Such  teaching is, however, in conflict with the traditions of all peoples  Jew,
Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, and Christian  which  speak of an age when man was both
innocent and happy. From this state  of primal perfection he fell, continuing his descent until such time as  the
great Avatara, Christ and others, descended to save  his race and enable it to regain the righteous path. The
Garden of Eden  is the emblem of the paradisiacal body of man. There man was one with  Nature. He was
himself paradise, a privileged enclosure in a garden of  delight  gan be Eden. Et eruditus est Moyse omni
sapientia Ægyptiorum . The Satya Yuga is, according to Hindu belief, the Golden Age of  righteousness, free
of sin, marked by longevity, physical strength,  beauty, and stature. "There were giants in those days" whose
moral,  mental, and physical strength enabled them to undergo long  brahmacharyya (continence) and
tapas (austerities).  Longevity permitted lengthy spiritual exercises. Life then depended on  the marrow, and
lasted a lakh of years, men dying when they  willed. Their stature was 21 cubits.
To this age belong the Avatara or incarnations of Vishnu, Matsya,  Kurma, Varaha, Nri−singha, and Vamana.
Its duration is computed to be  4,800 Divine years, which, when multiplied by 360 (a year of the Devas  being
equal to 360 human years) are the equivalent of 1,728,000 of the  years of man. (b) The second age, or Treta
(three−fourth) Yuga, is that  in which righteousness (dharmma) decreased by one−fourth. The  duration was
3,600 Divine years, or 1,296,000 human years. Longevity,  strength, and stature decreased. Life was in the
bone, and lasted  10,000 years. ManÕs stature was 14 cubits. Of sin there appeared  one−quarter, and of virtue
there remained three−quarters. Men were  still attached to pious and charitable acts, penances, sacrifice, and
pilgrimage, of which the chief was that to Naimisharanya. In this  period appeared the avatars of Vishnu as
Parashurama and Rama.  (c) The third, or Dvapara (one−half) Yuga, is that in which  righteousness decreased
by one−half, and the duration of which was  2,400 Divine, or 864,000 human, years. A further decrease in
longevity  and strength, and increase of weakness and disease, mark this age. Life  which lasted 1,000 years
was centred in the blood. Stature was 7  cubits. Sin and virtue were of equal force. Men became restless, and,
though eager to acquire knowledge, were deceitful, and followed both  good and useful pursuits. The principal
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

18

place of pilgrimage was  Kurukshetra. To this age belongs (according to Vyasa, Anushtubhacharya  and
Jiya−deva) the avatara of Vishnu as Bala−rama, the elder  brother of Krishna, who, according to other
accounts, takes his place.  In the sandhya, or intervening period of 1,000 years between  this and the next yuga
the Tantra was revealed, as it will be  revealed at the dawn of every Kali−yuga. (d) Kali−yuga is the alleged
present age, in which righteousness exists to the extent of one−fourth  only, the duration of which is 1,200
Divine,or 432,000 human, years.  According to some, this age commenced in 3120 B.C. on the date of
VishnuÕs return to heaven after the eighth incarnation. This is the  periodwhich, according to the Puranas and
Tantras, is characterized by  the prevalence of viciousness, weakness, disease, and the general  decline of all
that is good. Humanlife, which lasts at most 120, or, as  some say, 100, years,is dependent on food. Stature is
3½ cubits. The  chief pilgrimage is now to the Ganges. In this age has appeared the  Buddha Avatara. The last,
or Kalki Avatara,the Destroyer of sin,  has yet to come. It is He who will destroy iniquity and restore the age
of righteousness.The Kalki Purana speaks of Him as One whose body is  blue like that of the rain−charged
cloud, who with sword in hand rides,  as does the rider of the Apocalypse, a white horse swift as the wind,  the
Cherisher of the people, Destroyer of the race of the Kali−yuga,  the Source of true religion. And Jayadeva, in
his Ode to the  Incarnations,addresses Him thus: "For the destruction of all the impure  thou drawest thy
cimeter like a blazing comet. O how tremendous! Oh,  Keshava, assuming the body of Kalki! Be victorious. O
Hari, Lord of the  Universe!" With the Satya−yuga a new maha−yaga will commence,  and the ages will
continue to revolve with their rising and descending  races until the close of the kalpa or day of Brahma..
Then a  night of dissolution (pralaya) of equal duration follows, the  Lord reposing in yoga−nidra (yoga sleep
in pralaya) on  the Serpent Shesha, the Endless One, till day break, when the universe  is created anew and the
next kalpa follows.
The Scriptures of the Ages
Each of these Ages has its appropriate Shastra or Scripture,  designed to meet the characteristics and needs of
the men who live in  them The Hindu Shastra are classed into: (1) Shruti,  which commonly includes the four
Veda. (Rik, Yajuh, Sama, Atharva, and  the Upanishads), the doctrine of which is philosophically exposed in
the Vedanta−Darshana. (2) Smriti, such as the  Dharma−Shastra of Manu and other works on family and
social duty  prescribing for pavritti−dhamia, as the Upanishads had revealed  the nivritti−dharma. (3) The
Puranas, of which, according to the  Brahma−vaivartta Purana, there were originally four lakhs, and of which
eighteen are now regarded as the principal. (4) The Tantra.
For each of these ages a suitable Shastra is given. The Veda  is the root of all Shastra (mula−shastra). All
others are based  on it. The Tantra is spoken of as a fifth Veda. Kulluka−Bhatta, the  celebrated Commentator
on Manu, says that Shruti is of two  kinds, Vaidik and Tantrik (vaidiki−tantriiki chaiva dvi−vidha
shrutih−kirttita). The various Shastras, however, are  different presentments of shruti appropriate to the
humanity of  the age for which they are given. Thus the Tantra is that presentment  of shruti which is modelled
as regards its ritual to meet the  characteristics and infirmities of the Kali−yuga. As men have no longer  the
capacity, longevity, and moral strength necessary for the  application of the Vaidika Karma−kanda, the Tantra
prescribes a  special sadhana or means or practice of its own, for the  attainment of that which is the ultimate
and common end of all  Shastra. The Kularnava Tantra says that in the Satya or Krita age  the Shastra is
Shruti (in the sense of the Veda and  Upanishads); in Treta−yuga, Smriti (in the sense of the  Dharma−Shastra
and Shruti−jivika, etc.); in Dvapara Yuga the  Purana; and in the last or Kali−yuga the Tantra, which should
now be  followed by all orthodox Hindu worshippers. The Maha−nirvana and other  Tantras and Tantrik works
lay down the same rule. The Tantra is also  said to contain the very core of the Veda to which, it is described
to  bear the relation of the Paramatma to the Jivatma. In a  similar way, Kaulachara is the central informing
life of the  gross body called vedachara, each of the achara which  follow it up to kaulachara being more and
more subtle sheaths.

The Human Body
The human body is Brahma−para, the city of Brahman.  Ishvara Himself enters into the universe as
jiva. Wherefore the maha−vakya "That thou art" means that the ego  (which is regarded as jiva only from the
standpoint of an  upadhi) is Brahman.
The Five Sheaths
In the body there are five kosha or sheaths
anna−maya, prana−maya, mano−maya, vijñana−maya, ananda−maya , or the physical and vital bodies, the
two mental bodies, and  the body of bliss. In the first the Lord is self−conscious as being  dark or fair, short or
tall, old or youthful. In the vital body He  feels alive, hungry, and thirsty. In the mental bodies He thinks and
understands. And in the body of Bliss He resides in happiness. Thus  garmented with the five garments, the
Lord, though all pervading,  appears as though He were limited by them.
Anna−Maya Kosha
In the material body, which is called the "sheath of food" ( anna−maya kosha), reign the elements earth,
water, and fire,  which are those presiding in the lowest Chakra, the  Muladhara, Svadhishthana, and
mani−pura  centres. The two former produce food and drink, which is assimilated by  the fire of digestion, and
converted into the body of food. The  indriya are both the faculty and organs of sense. There are in this  body
the material organs, as distinguished from the faculty of sense.
In the gross body (sharira−kosha) there are six  external kosha  viz., hair, blood, flesh, which come from the
mother,  and bone, muscle, marrow, from the father.
The organs of sense (indriya) are of two kinds  viz.:  jnanendriya, or organs of sensation, through which
knowledge  of the external world is obtained (ear, skin, eyes, tongue, nose); and  karmendriya, or organs of
action  mouth, arms, legs, anus,  penis, the functions of which are speech, holding, walking, excretion,  and
procreation.
Prana−Maya Kosha
The second sheath is the prana−maya−kosha, or sheath  of "breath" (prana), which manifests itself in air and
ether, the presiding elements in the Anahata and Vishuddha  chakra.
There are ten vayu (airs), or inner vital forces, of which  the first five are the principal  namely, the sapphire
prana; apana, the colour of an evening cloud; the silver vyana ; udana, the colour of fire; and the milky
samana. These are all aspects of the action of the one Prana−devata.  Kundalini is the Mother of prana, which
She the  Mula−Prakriti, illumined by the light of the Supreme Atma, generates. Prana is vayu, or the universal
force  of activity, divided on entering each individual into fivefold  function. Specifically considered, prana is
inspiration, which  with expiration is from and to a distance of eight and twelve inches  respectively. Udana is
the ascending vayu. Apana  is the downward vayu, expelling wind, excrement, urine,  and semen. The
samana, or collective vayu, kindles the bodily fire, "conducting equally the food, etc.,  throughout the body."
Vyana is the separate vayu, effecting division and diffusion. These forces cause respiration,  excretion,
digestion, circulation.

The Human Body

Mano−maya, Vijñana Kosha, and  Ananda−maya Kosha
The next two sheaths are the mano−maya and vijñana kosha . These constitute the antah−karana, which is
fourfold  namely, mind in its twofold aspect of buddhi and  manas, self−hood (ahankara), and chitta. The
function of the first is doubt sangkalpa−vikalpatmaka, (uncertainty, certainty); of the second, determination
( nishchaya−karini); of the third (egoity), consciousness ( abhimana). Manas automatically registers the facts
which the  senses perceive. Buddhi, on attending to such  registration, discriminates, determines, and cognizes
the object  registered, which is set over and against the subjective self by  Ahangkara. The function of chitta is
contemplation ( chinta), the faculty whereby the mind in its widest sense  raises for itself the subject of its
thought and dwells thereon. For  whilst buddhi has but three moments in which it is born, exists,  and dies,
chitta endures.
The antah−karana is master of the ten senses, which are the  outer doors through which it looks forth upon
the external world. The  faculties, as opposed to the organs or instruments of sense, reside  here. The centres of
the powers inherent in the last two sheaths are in  the Ajna Chakra and the region above this and below the
sahasrara lotus. In the latter the Atma of the last sheath  of bliss resides. The physical or gross body is called
sthula−sharira . The subtle body (sukshma−sharira, also called  linga−sharira and
karana−shanra) comprises the ten  indriya, manas, ahangkara, buddhi, and  the five functions of prana. This
subtle body contains in  itself the cause of rebirth into the gross body when the period of  reincarnation arrives.
The atma, by its association with the upadhis, has three states of consciousness  namely, the jagrat, or  waking
state, when through the sense organs are perceived objects of  sense through the operation of manas and
buddhi. It is  explained in the Ishvara−pratya−bhijna as follows  "the waking state  dear to all is the source of
external action through the activity of  the senses." The jiva is called jagari that is, he who  takes upon himself
the gross body called Vishva. The second is  svapna, the dream state, when, the sense organs being
withdrawn,  Alma is conscious of mental images generated by the impressions of  jagrat experience. Here
manas ceases to record fresh sense  impressions, and it and buddhi work on that which manas has registered
in the waking state. The explanation of this state is  also given in the work last cited. "The state of svapna is
the  objectification of visions perceived in the mind, due to the perception  of ideas there latent." Jiva in the
state of svapna is  termed taijasa. Its individuality is merged in the subtle body.  Hiranyagarbha is the
collective form of these jiva, as  Vaisvanara is such form of the jiva in the waking state. The  third state is that
of sushupti, or dreamless sleep, when  manas itself is withdrawn, and buddhi, dominated by tamas , preserves
only the notion: "Happily I slept; I was not conscious of  anything" (Patanjala−yoga−sutra). In the Macrocosm
the upadhi of  these states are also called Virat, Hiranyagarbha, and  Avyakta. The description of the state of
sleep is given in the  Shiva−sutra as that in which there is incapacity of discrimination or  illusion. By the
saying cited from the Patanjala−sutra three  modifications of avidya are indicated  viz., ignorance, egoism,
and happiness. Sound sleep is that state in which these three exist.  The person in that state is termed prajna,
his individuality  being merged in the causal body (karana). Since in the sleeping  state the prajna becomes
Brahman, he is no longer jiva as  before; but the jiva is then not the supreme one (Paramatma ), because the
state is associated with avidya. Hence, because  the vehicle in the jiva in the sleeping state is Karana,  the
vehicle of the jiva in the fourth is declared to be  mahakarana. Ishvara is the collective form of the prajna
jiva .
Beyond sushupti is the turiya, and beyond turiya the transcendent fifth state without name. In the fourth state
shuddha−vidya is acquired, and this is the only realistic one for  the yogi which he attains through,
samadhi−yoga. Jiva in turiya is merged in the great causal body (maha−karana ). The fifth state arises from
firmness in the fourth. He who is in  this state becomes equal to Shiva, or, more strictly, tends to a close
equality; for it is only beyond that, that "the spotless one attains  the highest equality," which is unity. Hence
even in the fourth and  fifth states there is an absence of that full perfection which  constitutes the Supreme.
Bhaskara−raya, in his Commentary on the  Lalita, when pointing out that the Tantrik theory adds the fourth
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mano−maya, Vijñana Kosha, and  Ananda−maya Kosha
21

and  fifth states to the first three adopted by the followers of the  Upanishads, says that the latter states are not
separately enumerated  by them owing to the absence in those two states of the full perfection  of Jiva or of
Shiva.
Nadi
It is said that there are 3½ crores of nadi in the human  body, of which some are gross and some are subtle.
Nadi means a  nerve or artery in the ordinary sense; but all the nadis of which the  books on Yoga speak are not
of this physical character, but are  subtle channels of energy. Of these nadi, the principal  are fourteen; and of
these fourteen, ida, pingala, and sushumna are the chief; and, again, of these three  sushumna is the greatest,
and to it all others are subordinate.  Sushumna is in the hollow of the meru in the cerebro−spinal  axis. It
extends from the Muladhara lotus, the Tattvik earth  centre, to the cerebral region. Sushumna is in the form of
Fire ( vahni−svarupa), and has within it the vajrini−nadi in  the form of the sun (surya−svarupa). Within the
latter is  the pale nectar−dropping chitra or chitrini−nadi, which  is also called Brahma−nadi, in the form of
the moon ( chandra−svarupa,). Sushumna is thus triguna. The various lotuses in the different Chakra of the
body ( vide post) are all suspended from the chitra−nadi, the chakra being described as knots in the
nadi, which is as thin as the thousandth part of a hair. Outside the meru  and on each side of sushumna are the
nadi ida and  pingala. Ida is on the left side, and, coiling round  sushumna, has its exit in the left nostril.
Pingala is on  the right, and, similarly coiling, enters the right nostril. The  sushumna, interlacing ida and
pingala and the  ajna−chakra round which they pass, thus forms a representation of  the caduceus of Mercury.
Ida is of a pale colour, is moon−like ( chandra−svarupa), and contains nectar. Pingala is  red, and is sun−like
(suryya−svarupa), containing  "venom," the fluid of mortality. These three "rivers," which are united  at the
ajna−chakra, flow separately from that point, and  for this reason the ajna−chakra is called mukta
triveni. The muladhara is called Yukta (united)−tri−veni , since it is the meeting−place of the three
nadi, which  are also called Ganga (Ida), Yamuna (Pingala), and  Sarasvati (sushumna), after the three sacred
rivers of India.  The opening at the end of the sushumna in the muladhara  is called brahma−dvara, which is
closed by the coils of  the sleeping Devi Kundalini.
Chakra
There are six chakra, or dynamic Tattvik centres, in the body  viz.,  the muladhara, svadhishthana, mani−pura,
anahata, vishuddha, and ajna  which are described in the following notes. Over all there is the
thousand−petalled lotus (sahasrara−padma).
Muladhara
Muladhara 
is a triangular space in the midmost portion of the body, with the  apex turned downwards like a young girlÕs
yoni. It is  described as a red lotus of four petals, situate between the base of  the sexual organ and the anus.
"Earth" evolved from "water" is the  Tattva of this chakra. On the four petals are the four  golden varnas
"vang," "shang," "shang,"  and "sang," In the four petals pointed towards the four  directions (Ishana, etc.) are
the four forms of bliss  yogananda (yoga bliss), paramananda (supreme bliss),  samaj−ananda (natural bliss),
and virananda (vira bliss). In  the centre of this lotus is Svayambhu−linga, ruddy brown,  like the colour of a
young leaf. Chitrini−nadi is figured as a  tube, and the opening at its end at the base of the linga is  called the
door of Brahman (brahma−dvara), through which the  Devi ascends. The lotus, linga and brahma−dvara,
hang  downwards. The Devi Kundalini, more subtle than the fibre of the lotus,  and luminous as lightning, lies
asleep coiled like a serpent around the  linga, and closes with Her body the door of Brahman. The  Devi has
forms in the brahmanda. Her subtlest form in the  pindanda, or body, is called Kundalini, a form of Prakriti
pervading, supporting, and expressed in the form of the whole universe;  "the Glittering Dancer "(as the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Nadi
22

Sarada−tilaka calls Her) "in the  lotus−like head of the yogi." When awakened, it is She who gives birth  to the
world made of mantra. A red fiery triangle  surrounds svayambhu−linga, and within the triangle is the red
Kandarpa−vayu, or air, of Kama, a form of the apana vayu , for here is the seat of creative desire. Outside
the triangle is a  yellow square, called the prithivi−(earth)−mandala, to  which is attached the "eight thunders"
(ashta−vajra). Here is the vija "lang", and with it prithivi on the  back of an elephant. Here also are Brahma
and Savitri, and the red  four−handed Shakti Dakini. 
Svadhisthana
Svadhishthana 
is a six−petalled lotus at the base of the sexual organ, above  muladhara and below the navel. Its pericarp is
red, and its petals  are like lightning. "Water" evolved from "fire" is the Tattva of this  chakra. The varnas on
the petals are "bang," "bhang,"  "mang," "yang," "rang," and "lang." In the six petals are also the  vritti (states,
qualities, functions, or inclinations)  namely,  prashraya (credulity), a−vishvasa (suspicion, mistrust),  avajna
(disdain), murchchha (delusion, or, as some say,  disinclination), sarvva−nasha (false knowledge), and
krurata  (pitilessness). Within a semicircular space in the pericarp are the  Devata, the dark blue Maha−vishnu,
Maha−lakshmi, and Sarasvati. In  front is the blue four−handed Rakini Shakti, and the vija of  Varuna, Lord of
water or "vang." Inside the vija there is the  region of Varuna., of the shape of an half−moon, and in it is
Varuna  himself seated on a white alligator (makara). 
Mani−pura
Mani−para−chakra 
is a ten−petalled golden lotus, situate above the last in the  region of the navel. "Fire" evolved from "air" is the
Tattva of this  chakra. The ten petals are of the colour of a cloud, and on  them are the blue varnas  "dang,"
"dhang," "nang ," tang," "thang," "dang," "dhang," "nang ," "pang," "phang,"  and the ten vritti (vide
ante), namely, lajja (shame), pishunata  (fickleness), irsha (jealousy), trishna (desire),  sushupti (laziness),
vishada (sadness), kashaya  (dullness), moha (ignorance), ghrina (aversion, disgust),  bhaya (fear). Within the
pericarp is the vija of fire (" rang"), and a triangular figure (mandala) of Agni,  Lord of Fire, to each side of
which figure are attached three  auspicious signs or svastika. Agni, red, four−handed, and seated  on a ram, is
within the figure. In front of him are Rudra and his  Shakti Bhadra−kali. Rudra is of the colour of vermilion,
and is old.  His body is smeared with ashes. He has three eyes and two hands. With  one of these he makes the
sign which grants boons and blessings, and  with the other that which dispels fear. Near him is the four−armed
Lakini Shakti, of the colour of molten gold (tapta−kanchana),  wearing yellow raiments and ornaments. Her
mind is maddened with  passion (mada−matta−chitta). Above the lotus is the abode and  region of Suryya.
The solar region drinks the nectar which drops from  the region of the Moon. 
Anahata
Anahata−chakra 
is a deep red lotus of twelve petals, situate above the last and in  the region of the heart, which is to be
distinguished from the  heart−lotus facing upwards of eight petals, spoken of in the text,  where the patron
deity (Ishta−devata) is meditated upon.  "Air" evolved from "ether" is the Tattva of the former lotus. On the
twelve petals are the vermilion varnas  "Kang" "Khang ," "Gang," "Ghang," "ngang," "chang ", "Chhang,"
"Jang," "Jhang," "Nyang ," "Tang," "Thang," and the twelve vrittis (vide ante )  namely asha (hope),
chinta (care, anxiety), cheshta (endeavour), mamata (sense of mineness), dambha (arrogance or hypocrisy),
vikalata (languor), ahangkara (conceit), viveka (discrimination), lolata (covetousness), kapatata (duplicity),
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Svadhisthana

vitarka (indecision), anutapa (regret). A triangular mandala  within the pericarp of this lotus of the lustre of
lightning is known  as the Tri−kona Shakti. Within this mandala is a red  vana−linga, called Narayana or
Hiranya−garbha, and near it  Ishvara and His Shakti Bhuvaneshvari. Ishvara, who is the Overlord of  the first
three chakra, is of the colour of molten gold,  and with His two hands grants blessings and dispels fear. Near
him is  the three−eyed Kakini Shakti, lustrous as lightning, with four hands  holding the noose and
drinking−cup, and making the sign of blessing,  and that which dispels fear. She wears a garland of human
bones. She is  excited, and her heart is softened with wine. Here, also, are several  other Shakti, such as
Kala−ratri, as also the vija  of air (vayu) or "vang." Inside the lotus is a  six−cornered smoke−coloured
mandala, and the circular  region of smoke−coloured Vayu, who is seated on a black  antelope. Here, too, is
the embodied atma (jivatma), like  the tapering flame of a lamp. 
Vishuddha
Vishuddha chakra 
or Bharatisthana, abode of the Devi of speech, is  above the last and at the lower end of the throat
(kantha−mula).  The Tattva of this chakra is "ether." The lotus is of a smoky  colour, or the colour of fire seen
through smoke. It has sixteen  petals, which carry the red vowels  "ang," "ang" " ing," "ing," "ung," "ung","
"ring," " ring," "lring," "lring," "eng," "aing,"  "ong," "aung," "ang," "ah;" the seven  musical notes
(nishada, rishabha, gandhara, shadaja, madhyama, dhaivata and panchama):  "venom" (in the eighth petal);
the vija "hung," "phat ," "vaushat," "vashat," "svadha," "svaha," " namah," and in the sixteenth petal nectar
(amrita). In the  pericarp is a triangular region, within which is the androgyne Shiva,  known as
Arddha−narishvara. There also are the region of  the full moon and ether, with its vija "hang." The
akasha−mandala is transparent and round in shape. 
Akasha himself is here dressed in white, and mounted on a white  elephant. He has four hands, which hold the
noose (pasha), the elephant−hook (angkusha), and with the other he  makes the mudra which grant blessing
and dispel fear. Shiva is  white, with five faces, three eyes, ten arms, and is dressed in tiger  skins. Near Him is
the white Shakti Shakini, dressed in yellow  raiments, holding in Her four hands the bow, the arrow, the
noose, and  the hook.
Above the chakra, at the root of the palate ( talumula) is a concealed chakra, called  Lalana and, in some
Tantras, Kala−chakra. It is a red  lotus with twelve petals, bearing the following vritti  shraddha  (faith),
santosha (contentment), aparadha (sense of  error), dana (self−command), mana (anger), sneha  (affection),
shoka (sorrow, grief), kheda (dejection),  shuddhata (purity), arati (detachment), sambhrama  (agitation),
Urmmi (appetite, desire).
Ajna
Ajna chakra is also called parama−hula and mukta−tri−veni , since it is from here that the three nadis
Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna  go their separate ways. It is a  two−petalled lotus, situate between the two
eyebrows. In this Chakra  there is no gross Tattva, but the subtle Tattva mind is here.  Hakararddha, or half the
letter La, is also  there. On its two petals are the red varnas "hang "and " kshang." 
In the pericarp is concealed the vija "ong." In the two  petals and the pericarp there are the three guna
sattva, rajas, and tamas. Within the triangular  mandala in the pericarp there is the lustrous (tejo−maya) linga
in the form of the pranava (pranavakriti), which is called Itara. Para−Shiva, in the form of  hangsa
(hangsa−rupa) is also there with his Shakti  Siddha−Kali. In the three corners of the triangle are Brahma,
Vishnu,  and Maheshvara, respectively. In this chakra there is the white  Hakini−Shakti, with six heads and
four hands, in which are  jñana−mudra, a skull, a drum (damaru), and a  rosary.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Vishuddha

Sahasrara Padma
Above the ajna−chakra there is another secret chakra, called manas−chakra. It is a lotus of six petals, on
which are shabda−jñana, sparsha−jñana, rupa−jñana, aghrano−palabdhi, rasopabhoga, and svapna, or the
faculties of hearing, touch, sight, smell, taste, and sleep, or  the absence of these. Above this, again, there is
another secret  chakra, called Soma−chakra. It is a lotus of  sixteen petals, which are also called sixteen
Kala. These  Kala are called kripa (mercy), mriduta (gentleness),  dhairyya (patience, composure), vairagya
(dispassion),  dhriti (constancy), sampat (prosperity), hasya  (cheerfulness), romancha (rapture, thrill), vinaya
(sense  of propriety, humility), dhyana (meditation), susthirata  (quietude, restfulness), gambhiryya (gravity),
udyama  (enterprise, effort), akshobha (emotionlessness), audarya  (magnanimity), and ekagrata
(concentration).
Above this last chakra is "the house without support" ( niralamba−puri), where yogis see the radiant Ishvara.
Above  this is the pranava shining like a flame, and above pranava  the white crescent Nada, and above this
last the point Vindu. There is  then a white lotus of twelve petals with its head upwards, and over  this lotus
there is the ocean of nectar (sudha−sagara), the island of gems (mani−dvipa), the altar of gems
( mani−pitha), the forked lightning−like lines a, ka, tha, and therein Nada and Vindu. On  Nada and Vindu, as
an altar, there is the  Paramahangsa, and the latter serves as an altar for the feet  of the Guru; there the Guru of
all should be  meditated. The body of the Hangsa on which the feet of the Guru  rest is jñana−maya, the wings
Agama and Nigama , the two feet Shiva and Shakti, the beak Pranava, the eyes and throat Kama−Kala.
Close to the thousand−petalled lotus is the sixteenth digit of the  moon, which is called ama−kala, which is
pure red and  lustrous like lightning, as fine as a fibre of the lotus, hanging  downwards, receptacle of the lunar
nectar. In it is the crescent  nirvana−kala, luminous as the Sun, and finer than the  thousandth part of a hair.
This is the Ishta−devata of all. Near  nirvana−kala is parama−nirvana−Shakti, infinitely  subtle, lustrous as
the Sun, creatrix of tattva−jnana. Above it are Vindu and Visarga−Shakti, root and  abode of all bliss.
Sahasrara−padma 
or thousand petalled lotus of all colours  hangs with its head  downwards from the brahma−randhra above all
the chakra. This is the region of the first cause (Brahma−loka), the  cause of the six proceeding causes. It is
the great Sun both cosmically  and individually, in whose effulgence Parama−Shiva and Adya−Shakti  reside.
The power is the vachaka−Shakti or saguna−brahman, holding potentially within itself, the
gunas, powers, and planes. Parama−Shiva is in the form of the Great  Ether (paramakasha−rupi), the
Supreme Spirit (paramatma ), the Sun of the darkness of ignorance. In each of the petals  of the lotus are
placed all the letters of the alphabet; and whatever  there is in the lower chakra or in the universe
(brahmanda ) exist here in potential state (avyakta−bhava). Shaivas call this place
Shiva−sthana, Vaishnavas,  Parama−purusha, Shaktas, Devi−sthana, the  Sankhya sages
Prakriti−purusha−sthana. Others call it by  other names, such as
Hari−hara−sthana. Shakti−sthana, Parama−Brahma, Parama−hangsa, Parama−jyotih, Kula−sthana, and
Parama−Shiva−Akula. But  whatever the name, all speak of the same. 
The Three Temperaments
The Tantras speak of three temperaments, dispositions, characters ( bhava), or classes of men  namely, the
pashu−bhava  (animal), vira−bhava (heroic), and divya−bhava (deva−like  or divine). These divisions are
based on various modifications of the  guna (v. ante) as they manifest in man (jiva). It has been pointed out
that the analogous Gnostic classification  of men as material, psychical, and spiritual, correspond to the three
guna of the Sankhya−darshana. In the pashu the  rajo−guna operates chiefy on tamas, producing such dark
characteristics as error (bhranti), drowsiness (tandra ), and sloth (alasya). It is however, an error to  suppose
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Sahasrara Padma
25

that the pashu is as such a bad man; on the contrary, a  jiva of this class may prove superior to a jiva of the
next. If the  former, who is greatly bound by matter, lacks enlightenment, the latter  may abuse the greater
freedom he has won. There are also numerous kinds  of pashu, some more some less tamasik than others.
Some  there are at the lowest end of the scale, which marks the first advance  upon the higher forms of animal
life. Others approach and gradually  merge into the vira class. The term pashu comes from the  root pash, "to
bind." The pashu is, in fact, the  man who is bound by the bonds (pasha), of which the  Kularnava Tantra
enurnerates eight  namely, pity (daya),  ignorance and delusion (moha), fear (bhaya), shame ( lajja), disgust
(ghrina), family (kula), custom ( shila), and caste (varna). Other enumerations are given of  the afflictions
which, according to some, are sixty−two, but all such  larger divisions are merely elaborations of the simpler
enumerations.  The pashu is also the worldly man, in ignorance and bondage, as  opposed to the yogi and the
tattva−jnani. Three divisions of  pashsu are also spoken of  namely, sakala, who are  bound by the three
pasha, called anu (want of  knowledge or erroneous knowledge of the self), bheda (the  division also induced
by maya of the one self into many), and  karmma (action and its product. These are the three impurities
( mala) called anava−mala, maya−mala, and  Karmma−mala. Pratayakala are those bound by the first and
last, and Vijnana−kevala are those bound by anava−mala  only. He who frees himself of the remaining
impurity of anu becomes Shiva Himself. The Devi bears the pasha, and is the  cause of them, but She, too, is
pashupasha−vimochini, Liberatrix  of the pashu from his bondage.
What has been stated gives the root notion of the term pashu.  Men of this class are also described in Tantra
by exterior traits,  which are manifestations of the interior disposition. So the Kubjika  Tantra says: "Those
who belong to pashu−bhava .re simply  pashu. A pashu does not touch a yantra, nor make  japa of mantra at
night. He entertains doubt about  sacrifices and Tantra; regards a mantra as being merely letters  only. He lacks
faith in the guru, and thinks that the image is  but a block of stone. He distinguishes one Deva from another,
and  worships without flesh and fish. He is always bathing, owing to his  ignorance, and talks ill of others.
Such an one is called pashu, and he is the worst kind of man." Similarly the Nitya Tantra  describes the pashu
as  "He who does not worship at night, nor  in the evening, nor in the latter part of the day; who avoids sexual
intercourse, except on the fifth day after the appearance of the  courses (ritu−kalang vina devi ramanang
parivarjayet); who do not eat meat, etc., even on the five auspicious days ( parvvana)"; in short, those who,
following Vedachara,  Vaishnavachara, and Shaivachara, are bound by the Vaidik rules which  govern all
pashus.
In the case of vira−bhava, rajas more largely works on  sattva, yet also largely (though in lessening degrees,
until  the highest stage of divya−bhava is reached) works independently  towards the production of acts in
which sorrow inheres. There are  several classes of vira.
The third, or highest, class of man is he of the divya−bhava  (of which, again, there are several degrees  some
but a stage in  advance of the highest form of vira−bhava, others  completely realizing the deva−nature), in
which rajas operate on  sattva−guna to the confirmed preponderance of the latter.
The Nitya Tantra says that of the bhava the divya is  the best, the vira the next best, and the pashu the  lowest;
and that devata−bhava must be awakened through  vira−bhava. The Pichchhila Tantra says that the only
difference between the vira and divya men is that the  former are very uddhata, by which is probably meant
excitable, through the greater prevalence of the independent working of  the rajo−guna in them than in the
calmer sattvik temperament. It  is obvious that such statements must not be read with legal accuracy.  There
may be, in fact, a considerable difference between a low type of  vira and the highest type of divya, though it
seems  to be true that this quality of uddhata which is referred to is  the cause of such differences, whether
great or small.
The Kubjika Tantra describes the marks of the divya as he  "who daily does ablutions, sandhya; and wearing
clean  cloth, the tripundara mark in ashes, or red sandal, and  ornaments of rudraksha beads, performs japa
and  archchana. He gives charity daily also. His faith is strong  in Veda, Shastra, guru, and Deva. He  worships
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Sahasrara Padma
26

the Pitri and Deva, and performs all the  daily rites. He has a great knowledge of mantra. He  avoids all food,
except that which his guru offers him, and all  cruelty and other bad actions, regarding both friend and foe as
one and  the same. He himself ever speaks the truth, and avoids the company of  those who decry the
Devata. He worships thrice daily, and  meditates upon his guru daily, and, as a Bhairava, worships
Parameshvari with divya−bhava. All Devas he  regards as beneficial. He bows down at the feet of women,
regarding  them as his guru (strinang pada−talang drishtva guru−vad bhavayet sada). He worships the Devi
at night, and  makes japa at night with his mouth full of pan, and makes obeisance to the kula vriksha. He
offers everything  to the Supreme Devi. He regards this universe as pervaded by stri  (shakti), and as Devata.
Shiva is in all men, and the  whole brahmanda is pervaded by Shiva−Shakti. He ever strives for  the attainment
and maintenance of devata−bhava, and is  himself of the nature of a Devata.
Here, again, the Tantra only seeks to give a general picture, the  details of which are not applicable to all men
of the divya−bhava  class. The passage shows that it, or portions of it, refer to the  ritual divya, for some of the
practices there referred to  would not be performed by the avadkuta, who is above all  ritual acts, though he
would also share (possibly in intenser degree)  the beliefs of divya men of all classes  that he and all else  are
but manifestations of the universe−pervading Supreme Shakti.
According to the temperament of the sadhaka, so is the  form of worship and sadhana. In fact, the specific
worship and sadhana of the other classes is strictly prohibited  by the Tantra to the pashu.
It is said in this Tantra and elsewhere that, in the Kali−yuga,  divya and pashu dispositions can scarcely be
found. It may  be thought difficult at first sight to reconcile this (so far as the  pasha is concerned) with other
statements as to the nature of these  respective classes. The term pashu, in these and similar  passages, would
appear to be used in a good sense as referring to a man  who, though tamasic, yet performs his functions with
that obedience to  nature which is shown by the still more tamasic animal creation free  from the disturbing
influences of rajas, which, if it may  be the source of good, may also be, when operating independently, the
source of evil.
The Commentator explains the passage cited from the Tantra as  meaning that the conditions and character of
the Kali−yuga are not such  as to be productive of pasha−bhava (apparently in the sense  stated), or to allow of
its achara (that is, Vaidikachara ). No one, he says, can fully perform the vedachara, vaishnavachara, and
shavachara rites, without which  the Vaidik, Pauranik mantra, and yajna are  fruitless. No one now goes
through the brahma−charya ashrama, or adopts after the fiftieth year that called vana−prastha. Those whom
the Veda does not control cannot expect the fruit of Vaidik  observances. On the contrary, men have taken to
drink, associate with  the low, and are fallen; as are also those men who associate with them.  There can
therefore be no pure pashu. Under these  circumstances the duties prescribed by the Vedas which are
appropriate  for the pasha being incapable of performance, Shiva for the  liberation of men of the Kali Age has
proclaimed the Agama. "Now, there  is no other way." The explanation thus given, therefore, appears to
amount to this. The pure type of pashu for whom vedachara  was designed does not exist. For others who
though pasha are not  purely so, the Tantra is the governing Shastra. This, however, does not  mean that all are
now competent for virachara.
It is to be noted, however, that the Prana−toshini cites a passage  purporting to come from the Mahanirvana
Tantra, which is apparently in  direct opposition to the foregoing:
Divya−vira−mayo bhavah kalau nasti kada−chana
Kevalang pasha−bhavena mantra−siddhirbhavennrinam
.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

"In the Kali Age there is no divya or vira−bhava. It is only by the pashu−bhava that men may obtain
mantra−siddhi." 
This matter of the bhava prevalent in the Kali−yuga  has been the subject of considerable discussion and
difference of  opinion, and is only touched upon here.
Guru and Shishya
The Guru is the religious teacher and spiritual guide to  whose direction orthodox Hindus of all divisions of
worshippers submit  themselves. There is in reality but one Guru. The  ordinary human Guru is but the
manifestation on the phenomenal  plane of the Adi−natha Maha−kala, the Supreme Guru abiding in  Kailasa.
He it is who enters into and speaks with the voice of the  earthly Guru at the time of giving mantra. Guru is
the  root (mala) of diksha (imitation). Diksha is the  root of mantra. Mantra is the root of Devata; and Devata
is the root of siddhi. The Munda−mala Tantra  says that mantra is born of Guru and Devata of  mantra, so that
the Guru occupies the position of a  grandfather to the Ishta−devata.
It is the Guru who initiates and helps, and the relationship  between him and the disciple (shishya) continues
until the  attainment of monistic siddhi. Manu says: "Of him who  gives natural birth and of him who gives
knowledge of the Veda the  giver of sacred knowledge is the more venerable father. Since second or  divine
birth insures life to the twice−born in this world and the  next." The Shastra is, indeed, full of the greatness of
Guru . The Guru is not to be thought of as a mere man. There  is no difference between Guru, mantra, and
Deva.  Guru is father, mother, and Brahman. Guru, it is  said, can save from the wrath of Shiva, but none can
save from the  wrath of the Guru. Attached to this greatness there is,  however, responsibility; for the sins of
the disciple recoil upon him.
Three lines of Guru are worshipped: heavenly (divyangga ) siddha (siddhangga), and human (manavangga ).
The kala−guru are four in number, viz.: the Guru, Parama−guru, Parapara−guru, Parameshti−guru; each
of these being the guru of the preceding one. According to  the Tantra, woman with the necessary
qualifications may be a guru , and give initiation. Good qualities are required in the  disciple, and according to
the Sara−sangraha a guru should  examine and test the intending disciple for a year. The qualifications  of a
good disciple are stated to be good birth, purity of soul ( shuddhatma), and capacity for enjoyment, combined
with  desire for liberation (purushartha−parayanah). Those who are  lewd (kamuka), adulterous
(para−daratura), constantly addicted to sin (sada papa−kriya), ignorant,  slothful, and devoid of religion,
should be rejected.
The perfect sadhaka who is entitled to the knowledge of all  Shastra is he who is pure−minded, whose senses
are controlled ( jitendriyah), who is ever engaged in doing good to all  beings, free from false notions of
dualism, attached to the speaking  of, taking shelter with, and living in the supreme unity of the  Brahman. So
long as Shakti is not fully communicated (see next note) to  the shishyaÕs body from that of the guru, so long
the conventional relation of guru and shishya exists. A  man is shishya only so long as he is sadhaka. When,
however, siddhi is attained, both Guru and  Shishya are above this dualism. With the attainment of pure
monism,  naturally this relation, as all others, disappears.
Initiation
Diksha
Initiation is the giving of mantra by the guru. At the  time of initiation the guru must first establish the life of
the  guru in his own body; that is the vital force (prana−shakti) of the Supreme Guru whose abode is in the
thousand−petalled  lotus. As an image is the instrument (yantra) in which  divinity (devatva) inheres, so also is
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Guru and Shishya
28

the body of guru . The day prior thereto the guru should, according to  Tantra, seat the intending candidate on
a mat of kusha grass. He  then makes japa of a "sleep mantra" (supta−mantra) in his ear, and ties his crown
lock. The disciple, who should have  fasted and observed sexual continence, repeats the mantra thrice,
prostrates himself at the feet of the guru, and then  retires to rest. Initiation, which follows, gives spiritual
knowledge  and destroys sin. As one lamp is lit at the flame of another, so the  divine shanti, consisting of
mantra, is  communicated from the guruÕs body to that of the Shishya. Without daksha, japa of the
mantra, puja , and other ritual acts, are said to be useless. Certain  mantra are also said to be forbidden to
shudra and women. A  note, however, in the first Chalakshara Sutra, to the Lalita would,  however, show that
even the shudra are not debarred the use even  of the Pranava, as is generally asserted. For, according  to the
Kalika Purana (when dealing with svara or tone), whilst  the udatta, an−udatta, and prachita are  appropriate
to the first of these castes, the svara, called aukara, with anusvara and nada, is appropriate to shudra, who
may use the Pranava, either at the beginning or end of mantra, but not,  as the dvija may, at both places. The
mantra chosen for  initiation should be suitable (anukala). Whether a  mantra is sva−kula or a−kula to the
person about to  be initiated is ascertained by the kula−chakra, the  zodiacal circle called rashichakra and
other chakra which  may be found described in the Tantra−sara. Initiation by a woman is  efficacious; that by a
mother is eight−fold so. Certain special forms  of initiation, called abhisheka, are described in the  next note.
Abhisheka
Abhisheka 
is of eight kinds, and the forms of abhisheka which follow  the first at later stages, mark greater and greater
degrees of  initiation. The first shaktabhisheka is given on entrance into  the path of sadhana. It is so called
because the guru  then reveals to the shishya the preliminery mysteries of  shakti−tattva. By it the shishya is
cleansed of all  sinful or evil shakti or proclivities, and acquires a wonderful  new shakti. The next
purnabhisheka is given in the  stage beyond dakshinachara, when the disciple has  qualified himself by
purascharana and other practices to receive  it. Here the real work of sadhana begins. Asana, yama , etc.,
strengthen the discipleÕs determina,tion (pratijna ) to persevere along the higher stages of sadhana. The third
is the difficult stage commenced by krama−dikshabhisheka , in which it is said the great Vashishtha became
involved, and  in which the Rishi Vishvamitra acquired brahma−jnana, and so became a Brahmana. The
sacred thread is now worn round the neck  like a garland. The shishya, then undergoing various  ordeals
(pariksha), receives samrajyabhisheka and  maha−samrajyabhisheka, and at length arrives at the most  dificult
of all stages introduced by yoga−dikshabhisheka. In previous stages the sadhaka has performed the
panchanga−puraschharana, and, with the assistance of his  guru (with whom he must constantly reside, and
whose instructions  he must receive direct), he does the panchanga−yoga  that is,  the last five limbs of the
ashtanga. He is thereafter qualified for  purna−dikshabhisheka, and, following that,
maha−purna−diksha−bhisheka, sometimes called  viraja−grahanabhisheka. On the attainment of perfection
in  this last grade, the sadhaka performs his own funeral rite ( shraddha), makes purnahuti with his sacred
thread and  crown lock. The relation of guru and shishya now ceases.  From this point he ascends by himself
until he realizes the great  saying, SoÕham ("I am He"). At this stage, which the  Tantra calls jivan−mukta
(liberated whilst yet living), he is  called parama−hangsa.
Sadhana
Sadhana 
is that which produces siddhi (q.v.). It is the  means, or practice, by which the desired end may be attained,
and  consists in the exercise and training of the body and psychic  faculties, upon the gradual perfection of
which siddhi follows;  the nature and degree of which, again, depends upon the progress made  towards the
realization of the atma, whose veiling  vesture the body is. The means employed are various, such as worship
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Abhisheka
29

( puja), exterior or mental; shastric learning; austerities ( tapas); the pancha−tattva, mantra, and  so forth.
Sadhana takes on a special character, according to the  end sought. Thus, sadhana for brahma−jñana, which
consists in the acquisition of internal control (shama) over buddhi, manas, and ahangkara; external control
(dama) over the ten indriya, discrimination between the transitory and the external, and  renunciation both of
the world and heaven (svarga), is  obviously different from that prescribed for, say, the purposes of the  lower
magic. The sadhaka and sadhika are respectively the  man or woman who perform sadhana. They are,
according to  their physical, mental, and moral qualities, divided into four classes
mridu, madhya, adhimatraka, and the highest  adhimatrama, who is qualified (adhikari) for  all forms of
yoga. In a similar way the Kaula  division of worshippers are divided into the prakriti, or  common Kaula
following virachara, addicted to  ritual practice, and sadhana, with pancha−tattva; the
madhyama−kaulika, or middling Kaula,  accomplishing the same sadhana, but with a mind more  turned
towards meditation, knowledge, and samadhi; and  the highest type of Kaula (kaulikottama), who, having
surpassed all ritualism, meditates upon the Universal Self. 
Worship Generally
There are four different forms of worship corresponding with four  states (bhava). The realization that the
jivatma  and paramatma are one, that everything is Brahman, and that  nothing but the Brahman exists, is the
highest state, or brahma−bhava . Constant meditation by the yoga process upon the  Devata in the heart is the
lower and middlemost (dhyana−bhava ) japa (q.v.) and stava (hymns and  prayer) is still lower and the lowest
of all is mere external worship ( puja) (q.v.). Puja−bhava is that which  arises out of the dualistic notions of
worshipper and worshipped; the  servant and the Lord. This dualism exists in greater or less degree in  all the
states except the highest. But for him who, having realized the  advaita−tattva, knows that all is Brahman,
there is neither  worshipper nor worshipped, neither yoga nor puja, nor
dharana, dhyana, stava, japa, vrata , or other ritual or process of sadhana.
In external worship there is worship either of an image (pratima ), or of a yantra (q.v.), which takes its place.
The sadhaka should first worship inwardly the mental image of  the form assumed by the Devi, and then by
the life−giving ( prana−pratishtha) ceremony infuse the image with Her life by  the communication to it of
the light and energy (tejas) of the Brahman which is within him to the image without, from which  there bursts
the lustre of Her whose substance is consciousness itself ( chaitanya−mayi). She exists as Shakti in stone or
metal, or  elsewhere, but is there veiled and seemingly inert. Chaitanya  (consciousness) is aroused by the
worshipper through the  prana−pratishtha mantra.
Rites (karma) are of two kinds. Karma is either  nitya nr naimittika. The first is both daily and  obligatory, and
is done because so ordained. Such as the sandhya (v . post), which in the case of Shudras is in the Tantrik
form; and daily puja (v. post) of the  Ishta− and Kula−Devata (v. post); and  for Brahmamas the
pancha−maha−yajna (v. post). The second or conditional karma is occasional and voluntary,  and is kamya
when done to gain some particular end, such as  yajna for a particular object; tapas with the same end (for
certain forms of tapas are also nitya); and  vrata (v. post).
The Shudra is precluded from the performance of Vaidik rites, or the  reading of the Vedas, or the recital of
the Vaidik mantra. His worship is practically limited to that of the Ishta−Devata and the  Bana−linga−puja,
with Tantrik and Pauranik mantra and such  vrata as consist in penance and charity. In other cases the  vrata is
performed through a Brahmana. The Tantra makes no caste  distinctions as regards worship. All may read the
Tantras, perform the  Tantrik worship, such as the sandhya (v. post), and recite the Tantrik mantra, such as the
Tantrik  Gayatri. All castes, and even the lowest chandala, may be  a member of a chakra, or Tantrik circle of
worship. In  the chakra all its members partake of food and drink together,  and are deemed to be greater than
Brahmanas; though upon the break−up  of the chakras the ordinary caste and social relations are
re−established. All are competent for the specially Tantrik worship,  for, in the words of the Gautamiya
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Worship Generally
30

Tantra, the Tantra Shastra is for  all castes and for all women. The latter are also excluded under the  present
Vaidik system, though it is said by Shankha Dharma−shastra−kara  that the wife may, with the consent of her
husband, fast, take vows,  perform homa and vrata, etc. According to the  Tantra, a woman may not only
receive mantra, but may, as  a Guru, initiate and give it. She is worshipful as Guru, and as wife of  Guru. The
Devi is Herself Guru of all Shastras and woman, as, indeed,  all females who are Her embodiments are, in a
peculiar sense, Her  earthly representatives.
Forms of Achara
There are seven, or, as some say, nine, divisions of worshippers.  The extra divisions are bracketed in the
following quotation. The  Kularnava Tantra mentions seven, which are given in their order of  superiority, the
first being the lowest:
Vedachara, Vaishnavachara, Shaivachara, Dakshinachara, Vamachara, Siddhantachara
(Aghorachara, Yogachara ), and Kaulachara, the highest of all. The  achara is the way, custom, and practice
of a particular class of  sadhaka. They are not, as sometimes supposed, different  sects, but stages through
which the worshipper in this or other births  has to pass before he reaches the supreme stage of the
Kaula. Vedachara, which consists in the daily practice of the  Vaidik rites, is the gross body
(sthula−deha), which  comprises within it all other acharas, which are, as it  were, its subtle bodies
(sukshma−deha) of various  degrees. The worship is largely of an external and ritual character,  the object of
which is to strengthen dharma. This is the  path of action (kriya−marga). In the second stage the  worshipper
passes from blind faith to an understanding of the supreme  protecting energy of the Brahman, towards which
he has feelings of  devotion. This is the path of devotion (bhakti−marga), and the aim at this stage is the union
of it and faith previously  acquired. With an increasing determination to protect dharma and  destroy
a−dharma, the sadhaka passes into  Shaivachara, the warrior (kshatriya) stage,  wherein to love and mercy are
added strenuous striving and the  cultivation of power. There is union of faith, devotion (bhakti), and inward
determination (antar−laksha). Entrance is  made upon the path of knowledge (jnana−marga). Following  this
is Dakshinachara, which in Tantra does not mean  "right−hand worship," but "favourable"  that is, that achara
which is favourable to the accomplishment of the higher sadhana, and whereof the Devi is the Dakshina
Kalika. This stage commences  when the worshipper can make dhyana and dharana of the  threefold shakti of
the Brahman (kriya, ichchha, jñana), and understands the mutual connection (samanvaya ) of the three guna
until he receives purnabhisheka (q .v.). At this stage the sadhaka is Shakta, and qualified for the worship of
the threefold shakti of  Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshvara. He is fully initiated in the  Gayatri−mantra, and
worships the Devi Gayatri, the Dakshina Kalika, or  Adya Shakti  the union of the three Shakti. This is the
stage of  individualistic Brahmana−tattva, and its aim is the union of faith,  devotion, and determination, with a
knowledge of the threefold  energies. After this a change of great importance occurs, marking, as  it does, the
entry upon the path of return (nivritti). This it is which has led some to divide the achara into the two  broad
divisions of Dakshinachara (including the first four) and  Vamachara (including the last three), it being said
that men are  born into Dakshinachara, but are received by initiation  into Vamachara. The latter term does not
mean, as is  vulgarly supposed, "left−hand worship," but the worship in which woman ( vama) enters that is
lata−sadhana. In this  achara there is also worship of the Vama Devi. Vija is here  "adverse," in that the stage
is adverse to pravritti, which governed in varying degrees the preceding achara, and entry is here made upon
the path of nivritti, or  return to the source whence the world sprung. Up to the fourth stage  the sadhaka
followed pravrittimarga, the outgoing  path which led from the source, the path of worldly enjoyment, albeit
curved by dharma. At first unconsciously, and later  consciously, sadhana sought to induce nivrittt, which,
however, can only fully appear after the exhaustion of the  forces of the outward current. In
Vamachara, however, the  sadhaka commences to directly destroy pravritti, and  with the help of the Guru
(whose help throughout is in this necessary)  to cultivate nivritti. The method at this stage is to use  the force of
pravritti in such a way as to render them  self−destructive. The passions which bind may be so employed as to
act  as forces whereby the particular life of which they are the strongest  manifestation is raised to the universal
life. Passion, which has  hitherto run downwards and outwards to waste, is directed inwards and  upwards, and
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Forms of Achara

transformed to power. But it is not only the lower  physical desires of eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse
which must  be subjugated. The sadhaka must at this stage commence to cut  off all the eight bonds
(pasha) which mark the pashu  which the Kularnava Tantra enumerates as pity (daya), ignorance
(moha), shame (lajja), family ( kula), custom (shila), and caste (varna ). When Shri Krishna stole the clothes
of the bathing  Gopi, and made them approach him naked, he removed the  artificial coverings which are
imposed on man in the sangsara. The Gopi were eight, as are the bonds (pasha), and the errors by which the
jiva is misled are the clothes  which Shri Krishna stole. Freed of these, the jiva is  liberated from all bonds
arising from his desires, family, and society.  He then reaches the stage of Shiva (shivatva). It is the  aim of
Vamachara to liberate from the bonds which bind men to  the sangsara, and to qualify the sadhaka for the
highest grades of sadhana in which the sattvika guna predominates. To the truly sattvik there is neither
attachment, fear,  or disgust. That which has been commenced in these stages is by degrees  completed in those
which follow  viz.: Siddhantachara, and according to some, Aghorachara and Yogachara. The sadhaka
becomes more and more freed from the darkness of  the sangsara, and is attached to nothing, hates nothing,
and is ashamed of nothing, having freed himself of the artificial bonds  of family, caste, and society. The
sadhaka becomes, like Shiva  himself, a dweller in the cremation ground (smashana). He  learns to reach the
upper heights of sadhana and the mysteries  of yoga. He learns the movements of the different vayu  in the
microcosm the Kshudra−brahmanda, the regulation of  which controls the inclinations and propensities
(vritti). He learns also the truth which concern the macrocosm (brahmanda ). Here also the Guru teaches him
the inner core of Vedachara . Initiation by yoga−diksha fully qualifies him for  yogachara. On attainment of
perfection in ashtanga−yoga , he is fit to enter the highest stage of Kaulachara.
Kaula−dharma 
is in no wise sectarian, but, on the contrary, is the heart of all  sects. This is the true meaning of the phrase
which, like many another  touching the Tantra, is misunderstood, and used to fix the kaula with  hypocrisy
antah−shaktah, vahih−shaivah sabhayang  vaishnavahmatah nana  rupadharah kaulah vicharanti mahitale
(outwardly Shaivas; in gatherings, Vaishnavas; at heart, Shaktas; under  various forms the Kaulas wander on
earth). A Kaula is one who has  passed through these and other stages, which have as their own inmost
doctrine (whether these worshippers know it or not) that of Kaulachara.  It is indifferent what the KaulaÕs
apparent sect may be. The form is  nothing and everything. It is nothing in the sense that it has no power  to
narrow the KaulaÕs own inner life; it is everything in the sense  that knowledge may infuse its apparent
limitations with an universal  meaning. So understood, form is never a bond. The Vishva−sara Tantra,  says of
the Kaula that "for him there is neither rule of time; nor  place. His actions are unaffected either by the
phases of the moon or  the position of the stars. The Kaula roams the earth in differing  forms. At times
adhering to social rules (shishta), he at others  appears, according to their standard, to be fallen (bhrashta).
At times, again, he seems to be as unearthly as a ghost (bhuta  or pishacha) To him no difference is there
between mud  and sandal paste, his son and an enemy, home and the cremation ground." 
At this stage the sadhaka attains to Brahma−jnana, which is the true gnosis in its perfect form. On receiving
mahapurna−daksha he performs his own funeral rites and is dead to  the sangsara. Seated alone in some quiet
place, he  remains in constant samadhi, and attains its  nir−vikalpa form. The Great Mother, the Supreme
Prakriti  Maha−shakti, dwells in the heart of the sadhaka, which is  now the cremation ground wherein all
passions have been burnt away. He  becomes a Parama−hangsa, who is liberated whilst yet  living
(javan−mukta).
It must not, however, be supposed that each of these stages must  necessarily be passed through by each jiva
in a single life. On  the contrary, they are ordinarily traversed in the course of a  multitude of births. The
weaving of the spiritual garment is  recommenced where in a previous birth, it was dropped on death. In the
present life a sadhaka may commence at any stage. If he is born  into Kaulachara, and so is a Kaula in its
fullest sense,  it is because in previous births he has by sadhana, in  the preliminary stages, won his entrance
into it. Knowledge of Shakti  is, as the Niruttara Tantra says, acquired after many births; and,  according to the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Forms of Achara
32

Mahanirvana Tantra, it is by merit acquired in  previous births that the mind is inclined to Kaulachara.
Mantra
Shabda, or sound, which is of the Brahman, and as such  the cause of the Brahmanda, is the manifestation of
the  Chit−shakti Itself. The Vishva−sara Tantra says that tha Para−brahman,  as Shabda−brahman, whose
substance is all mantra, exists  in the body of the jivatma. It is either unlettered ( dhvani) or lettered
(varna). The former, which  produces the latter, is the subtle aspect of the jivaÕs vital  shakti. As the
Prapancha−sara states, the brahmanda  is pervaded by shakti, consisting of dhvani, also called
nada, prana, and the like. The  manifestation of the gross form (sthula) of shabda  is not possible unless
shabda exists in a subtle (sukshma) form. Mantras are all aspects of the Brahman and  manifestations of
Kula−kundalini. Philosophically shabda  is the guna of akasha, or ethereal space. It is  not, however, produced
by akasha, but manifests in it.  Shabda is itself the Brahman. In the same way, however, as in outer  space,
waves of sound are produced by movements of air (vayu); so in the space within the jivaÕs body waves of
sound are  produced according to the movements of the vital air (prana−vayu) and the process of inhalation
and exhalation. Shabda first  appears at the muladhara, and that which is known to us  as such is, in fact, the
shakti which gives life to the jiva . She it is who, in the muladhara, is the cause of  the sweet indistinct and
murmuring dhvani, which sounds  like the humming of a black bee.
The extremely subtle aspect of sound which first appears in the  Muladhara is called para; less subtle when it
has  reached the heart, it is known as pashyanti. When  connected with buddhi it becomes more gross, and is
called  madhyama. Lastly, in its fully gross form, it issues from  the mouth as vaikhari. As Kula−Kundalini,
whose substance  is all varna and dhvani, is but the manifestation  of, and Herself the Paramatma; so the
substance of all mantra is  chit, notwithstanding their external manifestation, as  sound, letters, or words; in
fact, the letters of the alphabet, which  are known as akshara, are nothing but the yantra  of the akshara, or
imperishable Brahman. This, however,  is only realized by the sadhaka when his shakti, generated by
sadhana, is united with the mantra−shakti .
It is the sthula or gross form of Kulakundalini, appearing in  different aspects as different Devata, which is the
presiding Devata ( adhishthatri) of all mantra, though it is the  subtle or sukshma form at which all sadhakas
aim. When  the mantrashakti is awakened by sadhana the Presiding  Devata appears, and when perfect
mantra−siddhi is acquired, the  Devata, who is sachchidananda, is revealed. The relations  of
varna, nada, vindu, vowel and consonant  in a mantra, indicate the appearance of Devata in  different forms.
Certain vibhuti, or aspects, of the  Devata are inherent in certain varna, but perfect  Shakti does not appear in
any but a whole mantra. Any  word or letter of the mantra cannot be a mantra. Only that mantra in which the
playful Devata has revealed any  of Her particular aspects can reveal that aspect, and is therefore  called the
individual mantra of that one of Her particular  aspects. The form of a particular Devata, therefore,  appears
out of the particular mantra of which that Devata is the  adhishthatri Devata.
A mantra is composed of certain letters arranged in definite  sequence of sounds of which the letters are the
representative signs.  To produce the designed effect mantra must be intoned in the  proper way, according to
svara (rhythm), and varna  (sound). Their textual source is to be found in Veda, Purana, and  Tantra. The latter
is essentially the mantra−shastra, and  so it is said of the embodied shastra, that Tantra, which  consists of
mantra, is the paramatma, the  Vedas are the jivatma, Darshana (systems of philosophy)  are the senses,
Puranas are the body, and Smriti are the limbs. Tantra  is thus the shakti of consciousness, consisting of
mantra. A mantra is not the same thing as prayer or self−dedication ( atma−nivedana). Prayer is conveyed in
what words the  worshipper chooses, and bears its meaning on its face. It is only  ignorance of shastrik
principle which supposes that mantra is  merely the name for the words in which one expresses what one has
to  say to the Divinity. If it were, the sadhaka might choose his  own language without recourse to the eternal
and determined sounds of  Shastra.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
33

A mantra may, or may not, convey on its face its meaning.  Vija (seed) mantra, such as
Aing, Kling, Hring, have no meaning, according to the ordinary use of  language. The initiate, however,
knows that their meaning is the own  form (sva−rupa) of the particular Devata, whose mantra  they are, and
that they are the dhvani which makes all letters  sound and which exists in all which we say or hear. Every
mantra  is, then, a form (rupa) of the Brahman. Though,  therefore, manifesting in the form and sound of the
letters of the  alphabet, Shastra says that they go to Hell who think that the  Guru is but a stone, and the
mantra but letters of the  alphabet.
From manana, or thinking, arises the real  understanding of the monistic truth, that the substance of the
Brahman  and the brahmanda are one and the same. Man− of mantra  comes from the first syllable of
manana, and −tra  from trana, or liberation from the bondage of the  sangsara or phenomenal world. By the
combination of man− and  −tra, that is called mantra which calls forth ( amantrana), the chatur−varga (vide
post), or four aims of sentient being. Whilst, therefore, mere prayer often  ends in nothing but physical sound,
mantra is a potent  compelling force, a word of power (the fruit of which is  mantra−siddhi), and is thus
effective to produce the  chatur−varga, advaitic perception, and mukti. Thus it is said that siddhi is the certain
result of japa  (q.v.). By Mantra the sought for (sadhya) Devata, is attained and compelled. By siddhi in
mantra is opened the vision of the three worlds. Though the purpose  of worship (puja), reading (patha),
hymn (stava ), sacrifice (homa), dhyana, dharana, and samadhi (vide post), and that of the  diksha−mantra
are the same, yet the latter is far more powerful,  and this for the reason that, in the first, the sadhakaÕs
sadhana−shakti only operates, whilst in the case of mantra  that sadhana−shakti works, in conjunction with
mantra−shakti , which has the revelation and force of fire, and than which  nothing is more powerful. The
special mantra which is received  at initiation (diksha) is the vija, or seed  mantra, sown in the field of the
sadhakaÕs heart, and the  Tantrik sandhya, nyasa, puja, and the like  are the stem and branches upon which
hymns of praise (stuti) and prayer and homage (vandana) are the leaves and  flower, and the
kavacha, consisting of mantra, the fruit.
Mantra 
are solar (saura) and lunar (saumya), and are masculine, feminine, or neuter. The solar are masculine and
lunar feminine. The masculine and neuter forms are called mantra. The feminine mantra is known as
vidya. The  neuter mantra, such as the Pauranik−mantra, ending with  namah, are said to lack the force and
vitality of the  others. The masculine and feminine mantra end differently. Thus,  Hung, Phat, are masculine
terminations, and "thang ," or svaha, are feminine ones. 
The Nitya Tantra gives various names to mantra. according to the number of their syllables, a one−syllabled
mantra  being called pinda, a three−syllabled one kartari, a mantra with four to nine syllables vija, with ten to
twenty syllables mantra, and mantra  with more than twenty syllables mala. Commonly, however,  the term
vija is applied to monosyllabic mantra. The Tantrik mantras called vija (seed) are so named  because they are
the seed of the fruit, which is siddhi, and because they are the very quintessence of mantra. They are short,
unetymological vocables, such as Hring, Shring, Kring, Hung, Aing, Phat, etc., which will be found
throughout the text. Each Devata has His or  Her vija. The primary mantra of a Devata is known  as the root
mantra (mula−mantra). It is also said that  the word mula denotes the subtle body of the Devata called
Kama−kala. The utterance of a mantra without  knowledge of its meaning or of the mantra method is a mere
movement of the lips and nothing more. The mantra sleeps. There  are various processes preliminary to, and
involved in, its right  utterance, which processes again consist of mantra, such  as, purification of the mouth
(mukha−shodhana), purification of the tongue (jihva−shodhana), and of the  mantra
(ashaucha−bhanga), kulluka, nirvvana, setu, nidra−bhanga, awakening of mantra,  mantra−chaitanya, or
giving of life or vitality to the  mantra. Mantrarthabhavana, forming of mental image of  the Divinity. There
are also ten sangskara of the mantra. Dipani is seven japa of the vija, preceded  and followed by one. Where
hring is employed instead of Ong  it is prana−yoga. Yoni−mudra is meditation on the Guru in the  head and on
the Ishta−devata in the heart, and then on the Yoni−rupa  Bhagavati from the head to the muladhara, and
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
34

from  the muladhara to the head, making japa of the yoni  vija (eng) ten times. The mantra itself is
Devata. The worshipper awakens and vitalizes it by  chit−shakti, putting away all thought of the letter,
piercing the six Chakra, and contemplating the Spotless  One. The shakti of the mantra is the
vachaka−shakti , or the means by which the vachya−shakti or object of  the mantra is attained. The mantra
lives by the energy of  the former. The saguna−shanti is awakened by sadhana and  worshipped, and She it is
who opens the portals whereby the  vachya−shakti is reached. Thus the Mother in Her saguna form  is the
presiding deity (adhishthatri Devata) of the  Gayatri−mantra. As the nirguna (formless) One, She is its
vachya−shakti. Both are in reality one and the same; but the  jiva, by the laws of his nature and its three
guna, must first meditate on the gross (sthula) form before he  can realize the subtle (sukshma) form, which is
his  liberator.
The mantra of a Devata is the Devata. The rhythmical vibrations of  its sounds not merely regulate the
unsteady vibrations of the sheaths  of the worshipper, thus transforming him, but from it arises the form  of the
Devata, which it is. Mantra−siddhi is the ability to make  a mantra efficacious and to gather its fruit in which
case the  mantra is called mantra−siddha. Mantra are classified  as siddha, sadhya, susiddha, and
ari, according as they are friends, servers, supporters, or destroyers  a matter which is determined for each
sadhaka by means of  chakra calculations.
The Gayatri Mantra
The Gayatri is the most sacred of all Vaidik mantras. In it the Veda lies embodied as in its seed. It runs: Ong
bhur  bhuvah svah: tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi: dhiyo yo nah  prachodayat. Om. "Ong. Let
us  contemplate the wondrous spirit of the Divine Creator (Savitri) of the  earthly, atmospheric, and celestial
spheres. May He direct our minds  (that is, ÔtowardsÕ the attainment of dharmma., artha, kama, and
moksha), Om." 
The Gayatrt−Vyakarana of Yogi Yajnavalkya thus explains the  following words: Tat, that. The word yat
(which)  is understood. Savituh is the possessive case of Savitri, derived from the root su, "to bring forth."
Savitri  is, therefore, the Bringer−forth of all that exists. The Sun (Suryya ) is the cause of all that exists, and
of the state in which  they exist. Bringing forth and creating all things, it is called  Savitri. The Bhavishya
Purana says Suryya is the visible Devata. He is  the Eye of the world and the Maker of the day. There is no
other Devata  eternal like unto Him. This universe has emanated from, and will be  again absorbed into, Him.
Time is of and in Him. The planets, sta.rs,  the Vasus. Rudras, Vayu, Agni, and the rest are but parts of Him.
By  Bhargah is meant the Aditya−devata, dwelling in the region of the  Sun (suryya−mandala) in all His
might and glory. He is to  the Sun what our spirit (atma) is to our body. Though He  is in the region of the sun
in the outer or material sphere He also  dwells in our inner selves. He is the light of the light in the solar  circle,
and is the light of the lives of all beings. As He is in the  outer ether, so also is He in the ethereal region of the
heart. In the  outer ether He is Suryya, and in the inner ether He is the wonderful  Light which is the Smokeless
Fire. In short, that Being whom the  sadhaka realizes in the region of his heart is the Aditya in the  heavenly
firmament. The two are one. The word is derived in two ways:  (1) from the root bhrij, "to ripen, mature,
destroy,  reveal, shine." In this derivation Suryya is He who matures and  transforms all things. He Himself
shines and reveals all things by His  light. And it is He who at the final Dissolution (pralaya) will in His
image of destructive Fire (kalagni) destroy  all things. (2) From bha = dividing all things into different
classes; ra = colour; for He produces the colour of all created  objects; ga, constantly going and returning.
The sun divides all  things, produces the different colours of all things, and is constantly  going and returning.
As the Brahmana−sarvasva says: "The Bhargah  is the Atma of all that exists, whether moving or motionless,
in  the three loka (Bhur bhuvah svah). There is  nothing which exists apart from it." 
Devasya 
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
The Gayatri Mantra
35

is the genitive of Deva, agreeing with Savituh. Deva  is the radiant and playful (lilamaya) one. Suryya is in
constant play with creation (srishti), existence (sthiti), and destruction (pralaya), and by His radiance
pleases all. (Lila, as applied to the Brahman, is the  equivalent of maya.) Varenyam = varaniya, or  adorable.
He should be meditated upon and adored that we may be  relieved of the misery of birth and death. Those who
fear rebirth, who  desire freedom from death and liberation and who strive to escape the  three kinds of pain
(tapa−traya), which are adhyatmika , adhidaivika, and adhibhautika, meditate  upon and adore the
Bharga, who, dwelling in the region of  the Sun, is Himself the three regions called
Bhur−loka, Bhuvar−loka, and Svar−loka. Dhimahi = dhya−yema , from the root dhyai. We meditate upon,
or let us  meditate upon.
Prachodayat = 
may He direct. The Gayatri does not so expressly state, but it is  understood that such direction is along the
chatur−varga, or four−fold path, which is dharmma, artha, kama, and moksha (piety, wealth, desire and its
fulfilment, and  liberation, vide post). The Bhargah is ever directing our  inner faculties (buddhi−vritti) along
these paths. 
The above is the Vaidika Gayatri, which, according to  the Vaidik system, none but the twice−born may utter.
To the Shudra  whether man or woman, and to women of all other castes it is forbidden.  The Tantra, which
has Gayatri−Mantra of its own, shows no such  exclusiveness; Chapter III., verses 109−111, gives the
Brahma−gayatri for worshippers of the Brahman: "Parameshva−raya  vidmahe para−tattvaya dhimahi: tan
no Brahma prachodayat "(May we  know the supreme Lord. Let us contemplate the Supreme essence. And
may  that Brahman direct us).
Yantra
This word in its most general sense means an instrument, or that by  which anything is accomplished. In
worship it is that by which the mind  is fixed on its object. The Yogini Tantra says that the Devi should be
worshipped either in pratima (image), mandala, or  yantra. At a certain stage of spiritual progress the  sadhaka
is qualified to worship yantra. The  siddha−yogi in inward worship (antar−puja) commences  with the
worship of yantra, which is the sign (sangketa ) of brahma−vijnana as the mantra is the  sangketa of the
Devata. It is also said that yantra is so  called because it subdues (niyantrana) lust, anger, and  the other sins of
jiva and the sufferings caused thereby.
This yantra is a diagram engraved or drawn on metal, paper,  or other substances, which is worshipped in the
same manner as an image  (pratima). As different mantra are prescribed for  different worships, so are
different yantra. The  yantras are therefore of various designs, according to the object  of worship. The cover
of this work shows a silver Gayatri yantra  belonging to the author. In the centre triangle are engraved in the
middle the words, Shri Shri Gayatri sva−prasada siddhing kuru  ("Shri Shri Gayatri Devi: grant me success"),
and at each inner corner  there are the vija Hring and Hrah. In the spaces  formed by the intersections of the
outer ovoid circles is the vija  "Hring." The outside circular band contains the vija " Tha" which indicates
"Svaha," commonly employed to terminate  the feminine mantra or vidya. The eight lotus  petals which spring
from the band are inscribed with the vija, "Hring, Ing, Hrah." The outermost band contains  all the matrika, or
letters of the alphabet, from ankara  to laksha. The whole is enclosed in the way common to all  yantra by a
bhupura, by which, as it were, the  yantra is enclosed from the outer world. The yantra when  inscribed with
mantra, serves (so far as these are  concerned) the purpose of a mnemonic chart of the mantra  appropriate to
the particular Devata whose presence is to be invoked  into the yantra. Certain preliminaries precede, as in the
case of a pratima, the worship of a yantra. The worshipper first meditates upon the Devata, and then arouses
Him  or Her in himself. He then communicates the divine presence thus  aroused to the yantra. When the
Devata has by the  appropriate mantra been invoked into the yantra, the vital airs (prana) of the Devata are
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Yantra
36

infused therein by the  prana−pratishtha ceremony, mantra, and mudra. The Devata is thereby installed in the
yantra, which  is no longer mere gross matter veiling the spirit which has been always  there, but instinct with
its aroused presence, which the sadhaka  first welcomes and then worships. Mantra in itself is Devata, and
yantra is mantra in that it is the body of the Devata who is  mantra.
Mudra
The term mudrais derived from the root mud, "to  please," and in its upasana form is so called because it
gives  pleasure to the Devas. Devanang moda−da mudra tasmat tang  yatnatashcharet. It is said that there are
108, of which 55  are commonly used. The term means ritual gestures made with the hands  in worship or
positions of the body in yoga practice. Thus of the first  class the matsya  (fish) mudra is formed in offering
arghya by placing the right hand on the back of the left and  extending, fin−like, on each side the two thumbs,
with the object that  the conch which contains water may be regarded as an ocean with aquatic  animals; and
the yoni−mudra which presents that organ as a  triangle formed by the thumbs, the two first fingers, and the
two  little fingers is shown with the object of invoking the Devi to come  and take Her place before the
worshipper, the yoni being  considered to be Her pitha or yantra. The  upasana mudra is thus nothing but the
outward expression of inner  resolve which it at the same time intensifies. Mudra are  employed in worship
(archchana) japa, dhyana (q .v.), kamya−karma (rites done to effect particular  objects), pratishtha
(q.v.), snana  (bathing), avahana (welcoming), naivedya (offering of  food), and visarjana, or dismissal of the
Devata. Some  mudra of hatha yoga are described sub voc. " Yoga." The Gheranda Sanghita says that
knowledge of the yoga  mudras grants all siddhi, and that their performance  produces physical benefits such
as stability, firmness and cure of  disease.
Sandhya
The Vaidika sandhya is the rite performed by the twice−born  castes thrice a day, at morning, midday, and
evening. The morning  sandhya is preceded by the following acts. On awakening, a  mantra is said in
invocation of the Tri−murtti and the sun,  moon, and planets, and salutation is made to the Guru. The Hindu
dvi−ja then recites the miantra: "I am a Deva. I am indeed  the sorrowless Brahman. By nature I am eternally
free, and in the form  of existence, intelligence, and Bliss." He then offers the actions of  the day to the Deity,
confesses his inherent frailty, and prays that he  may do right. Then, leaving his bed and touching the earth
with his  right foot, the dvi−ja says, "Om, 0 Earth! salutation to Thee,  the Guru of all that is good." After
attending to natural calls, the  twice−born does achamana (sipping of water) with mantra, cleanses his teeth,
and takes his early morning bath to the  accompaniment of mantra. He then puts on his caste−mark
( tilaka) and makes tarpanam, or oblation of  water, to the Deva, Rishi, and Pitri. The  sandhya follows, which
consists of achamana (sipping of  water), marjjana−snanam (sprinkling of the whole body with water  taken
with the hand or kasha−grass), pranayama  (regulation of prana through its manifestation in breath),
agha−marshana (expulsion of the person of sin from the body; the  prayer to the sun, and then (the canon of
the sandhya) the silent recitation (japa) of the Gayatn mantra, which consists of invocation (avahana) of the
Gayatri−Devi; rishi−nyasa and shadanga−nyasa (vide  post), meditation on the Devi−Gayatri in the morning
as  Brahmani; at midday as Vaishnavi; and in the evening as Rudrani;  japa of the Gayatri a specified number
of times; dismissal ( visarjana) of the Devi, followed by other mantra.
Besides the Brahmanical Vaidiki−sandhya from which the  Shudras are debarred, there is the
Tantriki−sandhya, which may be performed by all. The general outline is similar; the  rite is simpler; the
mantra vary; and the Tantrika−vijas  or "seed" mantras are employed.

Puja
This word is the common term for worship of which there are numerous  synonyms in the Sanskrit language.
Puja is done daily of the  Ishta−devata or the particular Deity worshipped by the sadhaka  the Devi in the case
of a Shakti, Vishnu in the case of a Vaishnava,  and so forth. But though the Ishta−devata is the principal
object of worship, yet in puju all worship the Pancha−devata , or the Five Deva  Aditya (the Sun), Ganesha,
the Devi, Shiva,  and Vishnu, or Narayana. After worship of the Pancha−devata, the family  Deity
(Kula−devata), who is generally the same as the  Ishta−devata, is worshipped. Puja, which is kamya, or done
to gain a particular end as also vrata, are  preceded by the sangkalpa; that is, a statement of the  resolution to
do the worship, as also of the particular object, if any,  with which it is done.
There are sixteen upachara, or things done or used in  puja: (1) asana (seat of the image); (2) svagata
(welcome); (3) padya (water for washing the feet); (4) arghya  (offering of unboiled rice, flowers, sandal
paste, durva grass,  etc., to the Devata in the kushi) (vessel); (5 and 6)  achamana (water for sipping, which is
offered twice); (7)  madhuparka (honey, ghee, milk, and curd offered in a silver or  brass vessel); (8) snana
(water for bathing); (9) vasana  (cloth); (10) abharana (jewels); (11) gandha (scent and  sandal paste is given);
(12) pushpa (flowers); (13) dhupa  (incense stick); (14) dipa (light); (15) naivedya (food);  (16) vandana or
namas−kara (prayer). Other articles are  used which vary with the puja, such as Tulasi leaf in the
Vishnu−puju and bael−(bilva) leaf in the Shiva−puja.  The mantras said also vary according to the worship.
The seat ( asana) of the worshipper is purified. Salutation being made  to the Shakti of support or the
sustaining force (adhara−shakti); the water, flowers, etc., are purified. All obstructive spirits  are driven away
(Bhutapasarpana), and the ten quarters  are fenced from their attack by striking the earth three times with the
left foot, uttering the Astra vija "phat," and by  snapping the fingers (twice) round the head. Pranayama
(regulation of breath) is performed and (vide post) the  elements of the body are purified
(bhuta−shuddhi). There  is nyasa (vide post); dhyana (meditation) offering  of the upachara; japa (vide
post), prayer  and obeisance (pranama). In the ashta−murti−puja  of Shiva the Deva is worshipped under the
eight forms: Sharvva (Earth),  Bhava (Water), Rudra (Fire), Ugra (Air), Bhima (Ether), Pashupati ( yajamana
the Sacrificer man), Ishana (Sun), Mahadeva (Moon).
Yajna
This word, which comes from the root yaj (to worship), is  commonly translated "sacrifice." The Sanskrit
word is, however,  retained in the translation, since Yajna means other things also  than those which come
within the meaning of the word "sacrifice," as  understood by an English reader. Thus the "five great
sacrifices" ( pancha−maha−yajna) which should be performed daily by the  Brahmana are: The homa
sacrifice, including Vaishva−deva  offering, "bhuta−yajna or vali, in which offerings  are made to Deva,
Bhuta, and other Spirits and to  animals; pitri−yajna or tarpana, oblations to the  pitri; Brahma−yajna, or
study of the Vedas and  Manushyayajna, or entertainment of guests (atithisaparyya ). By these five yajna the
worshipper places himself in  right relations with all being, affirming such relation between Deva,  Pitri,
Spirits, men, the organic creation, and himself.
Homa
, or Deva−yajna, is the making of offerings to  Fire. which is the carrier thereof to the Deva. A firepit
(kunda ) is prepared and fire when brought from the house of a Brahmana is  consecrated with mantra. The
fire is made conscious with  the mantra  Vang vahni−chaitanyaya namah, and then  saluted and named.
Meditation is then made on the three nadis ( vide ante) Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna  and on Agni, the Lord  of
Fire. Offerings are made to the Ishta−devata in the fire.  After the puja of fire, salutation is given as in
Shadanga−nyasa, and then clarified butter (ghee) is poured  with a wooden spoon into the fire with
mantra, commencing  with Om and ending with Svaha. Homa is of various  kinds, several of which are
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Puja
38

referred to in the text, and is performed  either daily, as in the case of the ordinary
nitya−vaishva−deva−homa , or on special occasions, such as the upanayana or  sacred thread ceremony,
marriage, vrata, and the like. It  is of various kinds, such as prayashchitta−homa, srishtikrit −homa, janu
homa, dhara−homa, and others,  some of which will be found in the text. 
Besides the yajna mentioned there are others. Manu speaks of  four kinds: deva, bhauta (where articles and
ingredients  are employed, as in the case of homa, daiva, vali), nriyajna, and pitri−yajna. Others are spoken
of, such as japa−yajna, dhyana−yajna, etc.  Yajna are also classified according to the dispositions and
intentions of the worshipper into sattvika, rajasika, and tamasika yajna.
Vrata
Vrata is a part of Naimittika, or voluntary  karma. It is that which is the cause of virtue (punya), and is done to
achieve its fruit. Vrata are of various kinds.  Some of the chief are Janmashtami on KrishnaÕs birthday;
Shiva−ratri in honour of Shiva; and the Shat−panchami, Durvashtami,  Tala−navami. Ananta−chaturdashi
performed at specified times in honour  of Lakshmi, Narayana, and Ananta. Others may be performed at any
time,  such as the Savitri vrata by women only, and the Karttikeya− puja by men only. The great vrata is the
celebrated  Durga−puja, maha−vrata in honour of the Devi as Durga, which  will continue as long as the sun
and moon endure, and which, if once  commenced, must always be continued. There are numerous other vrata
which have developed to a great extent in Bengal, and for which there  is no Shastric authority such as
Madhu−sankranti−vrata,  Jala−sankranti−vrata, and others. While each vrata has its  peculiarities, certain
features are common to vrata of differing  kinds. There is both in preparation and performance
sangyama, such as sexual continence, eating of particular food, such as  havishyanna, fasting, bathing. No
flesh or fish are taken.  The mind is concentrated to its purposes, and the vow or resolution ( niyama) is taken.
Before the vrata the Sun, Planets,  and Kula−devata are worshipped, and by the
"suryahsomoyamahkala" mantra all Deva and Beings are invoked to the side of the  worshipper. In the vaidika
vrata the sangkalpa is made in  the morning, and the vrata is done before midday.
Tapas
This term is generally translated as meaning penance or austerities.  It includes these, such as the four monthly
fast (chatur−masya), the sitting between five fires (pancha−gnitapah), and the like. It has, however, also a
wider meaning, and in this wider  sense is of three kinds, namely, sharira, or bodily;  vachika, by speech;
manasa, in mind. The first  includes external worship, reverence, and support given to the Guru,  Brahmanas,
and the wise (prajna), bodily cleanliness,  continence, simplicity of life and avoidance of hurt to any being
( a−hingsa). The second form includes truth, good, gentle, and  affectionate speech, and the study of the
Vedas. The third or mental  tapas in−cludes self−restraint, purity of disposition, silence,  tranquillity, and
silence. Each of these classes has three  subdivisions, for tapas may be sattvika, rajasika, or
tamasika, according as it is done with faith, and  without regard to its fruit; or for its fruit; or is done through
pride  and to gain honour and respect; or, lastly, which is done ignorantly or  with a view to injure and destroy
others, such as the sadhana of  the Tantrika−shat−karma, when performed for a malevolent  purpose
(abhichara).
Japa
Japa is defined as "vidhanena mantrochcharanam," or  the repeated utterance or recitation of
mantra according to  certain rules. It is according to the Tantra−sara of three kinds:  Vachika or verbal japa, in
which the mantra is  audibly recited, the fifty matrika being sounded nasally with vindu ; Upangshu−japa,
which is superior to the last kind, and in  which the tongue and lips are moved, but no sound, or only a slight
whisper, is heard; and, lastly, the highest form which is called  manasa−japa, or mental utterance. In this
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Vrata
39

there is neither sound  nor movement of the external organs, but a repetition in the mind which  is fixed on the
meaning of the mantra. One reason given  for the differing values attributed to the several forms is that where
there is audible utterance the mind thinks of the words and the process  of correct utterance, and is therefore to
a greater (as in the case of  vachika−japa), or to a less degree (as in the case of  upangshu−japa), distracted
from a fixed attention to the  meaning of the mantra. The japa of different kinds have  also the relative values
attachable to thought and its materialization  in sound and word. Certain conditions are prescribed as those
under  which japa should be done, relating to physical cleanliness, the  dressing of the hair, and wearing of silk
garments, the seat (asana ), the avoidance of certain conditions of mind and actions, and  the nature of the
recitation. The japa is useless unless done a  specified number of times  of which 108 is esteemed to be
excellent.  The counting is done either with a mala or rosary (mala−japa ), or with the thumb of the right hand
upon the joints of the  fingers of that hand (kara−japa). The method of counting  in the latter case may differ
according to the mantra.
Sangskara
There are ten (or, in the case of Shudras, nine) purificatory  ceremonies, or "sacraments," called
sangskara, which are  done to aid and purify the jiva in the important events of his  life. These are
jiva−sheka, also called  garbhadhana−ritu−sangskara, performed after menstruation,  with the object of
insuring and sanctifying conception. The  garbhadhana ceremony takes place in the daytime on the fifth day,
and qualifies for the real garbhadhana at night  that is, the  placing of the seed in the womb. It is preceded on
the first day by the  ritu−sangskara which is mentioned in Chapter IX. of the text. After  conception and
during pregnancy, the pung−savana and  simantonnayana rites are performed; the first upon the wife
perceiving the signs of conception, and the second during the fourth,  sixth, or eighth month of pregnancy.
In the ante−natal life there are three main stages, whether viewed  from the objective (physical) standpoint, or
from the subjective  (super−physical) standpoint. The first period includes on the physical  side all the
structural and physiological changes which occur in the  fertilized ovum from the moment of fertilization until
the period when  the embryonic body, by the formation of trunk, limbs, and organs, is  fit for the entrance of
the individualized life, or jivatma. When the pronuclear activity and differentiation are completed, the
jivatma, whose connection with the pronuclei  initiated the pro−nuclear or formative activity, enters the
miniature  human form, and the second stage of growth and de−velopment begins. The  second stage is the
fixing of the connection between the jiva  and the body, or the rendering of the latter viable. This period
includes all the anatomical and physiological modifications by which  the embryonic body becomes a viable
fÏtus. With the attainment of  viability, the stay of the jiva has been assured; physical life  is possible for the
child, and the third stage in ante−natal life is  entered. Thus, on the form side, if the language of comparative
embryology is used, the first sangskara denotes the impulse to  development, from the "fertilization of the
ovum" to the "critical  period." The second sangskara denotes the impulse to development  from the "critical
period" to that of the "viability stage of the  fÏtus "; and the third sangskara denotes the  development from
"viability" to "full term."
On the birth of the child there is the jata−karma, performed for the continued life of the new−born child.
Then follows  the nama−karana, or naming ceremony, and nishkramana  in the fourth month after delivery,
when the child is taken out of  doors for the first time and shown the sun, the vivifying source of  life, the
material embodiment of the Divine Savita. Between the fifth  and eighth month after birth the annaprasana
ceremony is  observed, when rice is put in the childÕs mouth for the first time.  Then follows the
chuda−karana, or tonsure ceremony; and  in the case of the first three, or "twice−born" classes,
upanayana , or investiture with the sacred thread. Herein the jiva  is reborn into spiritual life. There is, lastly,
udvaha, or marriage, whereby the unperfected jiva insures through  offspring that continued human life which
is the condition of its  progress and ultimate return to its Divine Source. These are all  described in the Ninth
Chapter of this Tantra. There are also ten  sangskara of the mantra (q.v.). The  sangskara are intended to be
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Sangskara

performed at certain stages in the  development of the human body, with the view to effect results  beneficial
to the human organism. Medical science of to−day seeks to  reach the same results, but uses for this purpose
the physical methods  of modern Western science, suited to an age of materiality; whereas in  the sangskara
the super−physical (psychic, or occult, or  metaphysical and subjective) methods of ancient Eastern science
are  employed. The sacraments of the Catholic Church and other of its  ceremonies, some of which have now
fallen into disuse, are Western  examples of the same psychic method.
Purashcharana
This form of sadhana consists in the repetition (after  certain preparations and under certain conditions) of a
mantra a  large number of times. The ritual deals with the time and place of  performance, the measurements
and decoration of the mandapa, or pandal, and of the altar and similar matters. There are certain  rules as to
food both prior to, and during, its performance. The  sadhaka should eat havishyanna, or alternately boiled
milk (kshira), fruits, or Indian vegetables, or anything  obtained by begging, and avoid all food calculated to
influence the  passions. Certain conditions and practices are enjoined for the  destruction of sin, such as
continence, bathing, japa (q. v.) of the Savitri−mantra 5,008, 3,008, or 1,008  times, the entertainment of
Brahmamas, and so forth. Three days before  puja there is worship of Ganesha and Kshetra−pala, Lord of the
Place. Pancha−gavya, or the five products of the cow, are  eaten. The Sun, Moon, and Devas are invoked.
Then follows the  sangkalpa. The ghata, or kalasa (jar),  is then placed into which the Devi is to be invoked. A
mandala, or figure of a particular design, is marked on the ground, and on  it the ghata is placed. Then the five
or nine gems are placed on  the kalasa, which is painted with red and covered with  leaves. The ritual then
prescribes for the tying of the crown lock ( shikha), the posture (asana) of the sadhaka; japa (q.v.) nyasa
(q.v.), and the  mantra ritual or process. There is meditation, as directed.  Kulluka is said, and the mantra
"awakened" ( mantra−chaitanya), and recited the number of times for which  the vow has been taken.
Bhuta−shuddhi
The object of this ritual, which is described in Chapter V., verses  93 et seq., is the purification of the elements
of which  the body is composed.
The Mantra−mahodadhi speaks of it as a rite which is preliminary to  the worship of a Deva. The process of
evolution from the Para−brahman  has been described. By this ritual a mental process of involution takes
place whereby the body is in thought resolved into the source from  whence it has come. Earth is associated
with the sense of smell, water,  with taste, fire, with sight, air, with touch, and ether, with sound.  Kundalini is
roused, and led to the svadhishthana Chakra. The "earth" element is dissolved by that of "water," as "water"
is by  "fire," "fire" by "air," and "air" by "ether." This is absorbed by a  higher emanation, and that by a higher,
and so on, until the Source of  all is reached. Having dissolved each gross element (maha−bhuta), together
with the subtle element (tan−matra) from  which it proceeds, and the connected organ of sense (indriya) by
another, the worshipper absorbs the last element, "ether," with the  tan−matra sound into self−hood
(ahangkara), the  latter into Mahat, and that, again, into Prakriti, thus  retracing the steps of evolution. Then, in
accordance with the monistic  teaching of the Vedanta, Prakriti is Herself thought of as the Brahman,  of which
She is the energy, and with which, therefore, She is already  one. Thinking then of the black Purusha, which
is the  image of all sin, the body is purified by mantra, accompanied by kumbhaka and rechaka, and the
sadhaka meditates upon the new celestial (deva) body,  which has thus been made and which is then
strengthened by a "celestial  gaze."
Nyasa
This word, which comes from the root "to place," means placing the  tips of the fingers and palm of the right
hand on various parts of the  body, accompanied by particular mantra. The nyasa  are of various kinds.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Purashcharana
41

Jiva−nyasa follows upon bhuta−shuddhi . After the purification of the old, and the formation of the  celestial
body, the sadhaka proceeds by jiva−nyasa to  infuse the body with the life of the Devi. Placing his hand on
his  heart, he says the "soÕhang" mantra ("I am He"),  thereby identifying himself with the Devi. Then,
placing the eight  Kula−kundalini in their several places he says the following mantra:
Ang, Kring, Kring, Yang, Rang, Lang , Vang, Shang, Shang, Sang, Hong, Haung, Hangsah: the vital airs of
the highly blessed and  auspicious Primordial Kalika are here. "Ang, etc., the  embodied spirit of the highly
blessed and auspicious Kalika is placed  here." "Ang, etc., here are all the senses of the highly  auspicious and
blessed Kalika," and, lastly, "Ang, etc.,  may the speech, mind, sight, hearing, smell, and vital airs of the
highly blessed and auspicious Kalika coming here always abide here in  peace and happiness Svaha." The
sadhaka then  becomes devata−maya. After having thus dissolved the  sinful body, made a new Deva body,
and infused it with the life of the  Devi, he proceeds to matrika−nyasa. Mahika are the fifty  letters of the
Sanskrit alphabet; for as from a mother comes birth, so  from matrika, or sound, the world proceeds.
Shabda−brahman, the "Sound," "Logos," or "Word," is the  Creator of the worlds of name and of form.
The bodies of the Devata are composed of the fifty matrika. The sadhaka, therefore, first sets mentally
( antar−matrika−nyasa) in their several places in the six  chakra, and then externally by physical action
( Vahy−amatrika−nyasa) the letters of the alphabet which form  the different parts of the body of the Devata,
which is thus built up  in the sadhaka himself. He places his hand on different parts of  his body, uttering
distinctly at the same time the appropriate  matrika for that part.
The mental disposition in the chakra is as follows: In the  Ajna Lotus, Hang, Kshang (each letter in this and
the  succeeding cases is said, followed by the mantra namah); in the Vishuddha Lotus Ang, Ang, and the  rest
of the vowels; in the Anahata Lotus kang, khang  to thang; in the Manipura Lotus, dang dhang, etc., to
Phang; in the Svadisthana Lotus bang , bhang to lang; and, lastly, in the Muladhara  Lotus,
vang, shang, shang, sang. The  external disposition then follows. The vowels in their order with  anusvara and
visarga are placed on the forehead, face, right  and left eye, right and left ear, right and left nostril, right and
left cheek, upper and lower lip, upper and lower teeth, head, and  hollow of the mouth. The consonants kang
to vang are  placed on base of right arm and the elbow, wrist, base and tips of  fingers, left arm, right and left
leg, right and left side, back,  navel, belly, heart, right and left shoulder, space between the  shoulders
(kakuda), and then from the heart to the right  palm shang is placed; and from the heart to the left palm the
(second) shang; from the heart to the right foot, sang; from the heart to the left foot, hang; and, lastly, from
the heart to the belly, and from the heart to the mouth, kshang.  In each case ong is said at the beginning and
namah at  the end. According to the Tantra−sara, matrika−nyasa is also  classified into four kinds, performed
with different aims  viz.:  kevala where the matrika is pronounced without vindu; vindu−sangyuta with
vindu; sangsarga with visarga ; and sobhya with visarga and vindu.
Rishi−nyasa
then follows for the attainment of the chatur−varga. The assignment of the mantra is to the head, mouth,
heart,  anus, the two feet, and all the body generally. The mantra  commonly employed are: "In the head,
salutation to the Rishi (Revealer)  Brahma; in the mouth, salutation to the mantra Gayatri, in the heart,
salutation to the Devi Mother Sarasvati; in the hidden  part, salutation to the vija, the consonants; salutation
to the shakti, the vowels in the feet, salutation to  visargah, the kilaka in the whole body." Another form  in
which the vija employed is that of the Aiya: it is  referred to but not given in Chap. V., verse 123, and is: "In
the head,  salutation to Brahma and the Brahmarshis, in the mouth,  salutation to Gayatri and the other forms
of verse; in the heart,  salutation to the primordial Devata Kali, in the hidden part,  salutation to the
vija, kring; in the two feet,  salutation to the shakti, Hring; in all the body,  salutation to the Kalika Shring." 
Then follows anga−nyasa and kara−nyasa. These  are both forms of shad−anga−nyasa. When
shad−anga−nyasa is performed on the body, it is called  hridayadi−shad−anga−nyasa; and when done with
the five  fingers and palms of the hands only, angushthadi−shad−anga−nyasa. The former kind is done as
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Purashcharana
42

follows: The short vowel a, the consonants of the ka−varga group, and the long vowel a , are recited with
"hridayaya namah" (namah  salutation to the heart). The short vowel i, the  consonants of the cha−varga
group, and the long vowel i,  are said with "shirasi svaha" (svaha to the head).  The hard ta−varga consonants
set between the two vowels u  are recited with "shikhayai vashat" (vashat to the crown  lock); similarly the
soft ta−varga between the vowels e  and ai are said with "kavachaya hung." The short  vowel o, the
pavarga, and the long vowel  o are recited with netra−trayaya vaushat (vaushat to  the three eyes). Lastly,
between vindu and visargah the  consonants ya to ksha with "kara−tala−prishthabhyang  astraya phat" (phat
to the front and back of the  palm).
The mantras of shadanga−nyasa on the body are used for  Kara−nyasa, in which they are assigned to the
thumbs, the  "threatening" or index fingers, the middle fingers, the fourth, little  fingers, and the front and back
of the palm.
These actions on the body, fingers, and palms also stimulate the  nerve centres and nerves therein.
In pitha−nyasa the pitha are established in place of the  matrika. The pitha, in their ordinary sense, are
Kama−rupa and the  other places, a list of which is given in the Yogini−hridaya.
For the attainment of that state in which the sadhaka feels  that the bhava (nature, disposition) of the Devata
has come upon  him nyasa is a great auxiliary. It is, as it were, the wearing  of jewels on different parts of the
body. The vija of the Devata  are the jewels which the sudkaka places on the different parts  of his body. By
nyasa he places his Abhishta−devata in  such parts, and by vyapaka−nyasa he spreads Its presence  throughout
himself. He becomes permeated by it losing himself in the  divine Self.
Nyasa 
is also of use in effecting the proper distribution of the  shaktis of the human frame in their proper positions so
as to avoid  the production of discord and distraction in worship. Nyasa as  well as Asana are necessary for
the production of the desired  state of mind and of chitta−shuddhi (its purification). "Das  denken ist der mass
der Dinge." Transformation of thought is  Transformation of being. This is the essential principle and rational
basis of all this and similar Tantrik sadhana.
Panchatattva
There are, as already stated, three classes of men  pashu, Vira, and Divya. The operation of the guna  which
produce these types affect, on the gross material plane, the  animal tendencies, manifesting in the three chief
physical functions  eating and drinking, whereby the annamayakosha is maintained;  and sexual intercourse,
by which it is reproduced. These functions are  the subject of the panchatattva or panchamakara ("five
mÕs"), as they are vulgarly called  viz.: madya (wine),  mangsa (meat), matsya (fish), mudra (parched grain),
and maithuna (coition). In ordinary parlance, mudra means  ritual gestures or positions of the body in worship
and hathayoga , but as one of the five elements it is parched cereal, and is  defined as Bhrishtadanyadikang
yadyad chavyaniyam prachakshate, sa mudra kathita devi sarvveshang naganam−dini. The Tantras  speak of
the five elements as pancha−tattva, kuladravya, kulatattva, and certain of the elements have esoteric  names,
such as Karanavari or tirtha−vari, for  wine, the fifth element being usually called lata−sadhana ( sadhana
with woman, or shakti). The five elements,  moreover have various meanings, according as they form part of
the  tamasika (pashvachara), rajasika (virachara), or divya or sattvika sadhanas respectively.
All the elements or their substitutes are purified and consecrated,  and then, with the appropriate ritual, the
first four are consumed,  such consumption being followed by lata−sadhana or its symbolic  equivalent. The
Tantra prohibits indiscriminate use of the elements,  which may be consumed or employed only after
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Panchatattva
43

purification (sho−dhana ) and during worship according to the Tantric ritual. Then,  also, all excess is
forbidden. The Shyama−rahasya says that  intemperance leads to Hell, and this Tantra condemns it in Chapter
V. A  well−known saying in Tantra describes the true "hero" (vira) to be, not he who is of great physical
strength and prowess, the great  eater and drinker, or man of powerful sexual energy, but he who has
controlled his senses, is a truth−seeker, ever engaged in worship, and  who has sacrificed lust and all other
passions. (Jitendriyah  satyavadi nityanushthanatatparah kamadi−validanashcha sa vira iti giyate .)
The elements in their literal sense are not available in sadhana  for all. The nature of the Pashu requires strict
adherence to  Vaidik rule in the matter of these physical functions even in worship.  This rule prohibits the
drinking of wine, a substance subject to the  three curses of
Brahma, Kacha, and Krishna, in the following terms:  Madyamapeyamadeyamagrahyam ("Wine must not be
drunk, given, or  taken"). The drinking of wine in ordinary life for satisfaction of the  sensual appetite is, in
fact, a sin, involving prayaschiyta, and entailing, according to the Vishnu Purama, punishment in the same
Hell as that to which a killer of a Brahmana goes. As regards flesh and  fish, the higher castes (outside
Bengal) who submit to the orthodox  Smarta discipline eat neither. Nor do high and strict Brahmanas  even in
that Province. But the bulk of the people there, both men and  women, eat fish, and men consume the flesh of
male goats which have  been previously offered to the Deity. The Vaidika dharmma is  equally strict upon the
subject of sexual intercourse. Maithuna  other than with the householderÕs own wife is condemned. And this
is  not only in its literal sense, but in that of which is known as  Ashtanga (eight−fold) maithuna  viz.,
smaranam  (thinking upon it), kirttanam (talking of it), keli (play  with women), prekshanam (looking upon
women), guhyabhashanan  (talk in private with women), sangkalpa (wish or resolve for
maithuua), adhyavasaya (determination towards it),  kriyanishpati (actual accomplishment of the sexual act).
In short,  the pashu (and except for ritual purposes those who are not  pashu) should, in the words of the
Shaktakramya, avoid  maithuna, conversation on the subject, and assemblies of  women (maithunam
tatkathalapang tadgoshthing parivarjjayet ). Even in the case of the householderÕs own wife marital
continency is enjoined. The divinity in woman, which the Tantra in  particular proclaims, is also recognized in
the ordinary Vaidik  teaching, as must obviously be the case given the common foundation  upon which all the
Shastra rest. Woman is not to be regarded  merely as an object of enjoyment, but as a house−goddess
(grihadevata ). According to the sublime notions of Shruti, the  union of man and wife is a veritable sacrificial
rite  a sacrifice in  fire (homa), wherein she is both hearth (kunda)  and flame  and he who knows this as homa
attains liberation.  Similarly the Tantrika Mantra for the Shivashakti Yoga runs:  "This is the in−ternal homa in
which, by the path of sushumna , sacrifice is made of the functions of sense to the spirit as  fire kindled with
the ghee of merit and demerit taken from the mind as  the ghee−pot Svaha." It is not only thus that wife and
husband are associated, for the Vaidika dharmma (in this now  neglected) prescribes that the householder
should worship in company  with his wife. Brahmacharyya, or continency, is not as is  sometimes supposed, a
requisite of the student ashrama only, but  is a rule which governs the married householder (grihastha) also.
According to Vaidika injunctions, union of man and wife must  take place once a month on the fifth day after
the cessation of the  menses, and then only. Hence it is that the Nitya Tantra, when giving  the characteristics
of a pashu, says that he is one who  avoids sexual union except on the fifth day (ritukalangvina devi
rama−nang parivarjjayet). In other words, the pashu  is he who in this case, as in other matters, follows for
all purposes,  ritual or otherwise, the Vaidik injunctions which govern the ordinary  life of all.
The above−mentioned rules govern the life of all men. The only  exception which the Tantra makes is for
purpose of sudhana in  the case of those who are competent (adhikari) for  virachara. It is held, indeed, that
the exception is not  strictly an exception to Vaidik teaching at all, and that it is an  error to suppose that the
Tantrika rahasya−puja is opposed to  the Vedas. Thus, whilst the vaidik rule prohibits the use of wine in
ordinary life, and for purpose of mere sensual gratification it  prescribes the religious yajna with wine. This
ritual use the  Tantra also allows, provided that the sadhaka is competent for  the sadhana, in which its
consumption is part of its  ritual and method.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Panchatattva
44

The Tantra enforces the Vaidik rule in all cases, ritual or  otherwise, for those who are governed by the
vaidikachara. The Nitya Tantra says: "They (pashu) should never  worship the Devi during the latter part of
the day in the evening or at  night" (ratrau naiva yajeddeving sandhyayang vaparanhake); for all such
worship connotes maithuna prohibited to the  pashu. In lieu of it, varying substitutes are prescribed,  such as
either an offering of flowers with the hands formed into the  kachchchapa mudra, or union with the
worshipperÕs own wife.  In the same way, in lieu of wine, the pashu should (if a  Brahmana) take milk, (if a
Kshattriya) ghee, (if a  vaishya) honey, and (if a shudra) a liquor  made from rice. Salt, ginger, sesamum,
wheat, mashkalai (beans),  and garlic are various substitutes for meat; and the white brinjal  vegetable, red
radish, masur (a kind of gram), red sesamum, and  paniphala (an aquatic plant), take the place of fish. Paddy,
rice,  wheat, and gram geneally are mudra.
The vira, or rather he who is qualified (adhikari ) for virachara  since the true vira is its finished  product
commences sadhana with the rajasika panchatattva  first stated, which are employed for the destruction of
the sensual  tendencies which they connote. For the worship of Shakti the  panchatattva are declared to be
essential. This Tantra declares  that such worship without their use is but the practice of evil magic.
Upon this passage the commentator Jaganmohana Tarkalangkara observes  as follows: "Let us consider what
most contributes to the fall of a  man, making him forget his duty, sink into sin, and die an early death.  First
among these are wine and women, fish, meat and mudra, and accessories. By these things men have lost their
manhood. Shiva  then desires to employ these very poisons in order to eradicate the  poison in the human
system. Poison is the antidote for poison. This is  the right treatment for those who long for drink or lust for
women. The  physician must, however, be an experienced one. If there be a mistake  as to the application, the
patient is like to die. Shiva has said that  the way of Kulachara is as difficult as it is to walk on the  edge of a
sword or to hold a wild tiger. There isa secret argument in  favour of the panchatattva, and those tattva so
understood should be followed by all. None, however, but the initiate  can grasp this argument, and therefore
Shiva has directed that it  should not be revealed before anybody and everybody. An initiate, when  he sees a
woman, will worship her as his own mother or goddess ( Ishtadevata), and bow before her. The Vishnu
Purana  says that by feeding your desires you cannot satisfy them. It is like  pouring ghee on fire. Though this
is true, an experienced spiritual  teacher (guru) will know how, by the application of this  poisonous medicine,
to kill the poison of sangsara. Shiva  has, however, prohibited the indiscriminate publication of this. The
meaning of this passage would therefore appear to be this: "The object  of Tantrika worship is
brahmasayujya, or union with  Brahman. If that is not attained, nothing is attained. And, with menÕs
propensities as they are, this can only be attained through the special  treatment prescribed by the Tantras. If
this is not followed, then the  sensual pro−pensities are not eradicated, and the work is for the  desired end of
Tantra as useless as magic which, worked by such a man,  leads only to the injury of others." The other secret
argument here  referred to is that by which it is shown that the particular may be  raised to the universal life by
the vehicle of those same passions,  which, when flowing only in an outward and downward current, are the
most powerful bonds to bind him to the former. The passage cited refers  to the necessity for the spiritual
direction of the Guru. To the want  of such is accredited the abuses of the system. When the patient ( sishya)
and the disease are working together, there is poor hope  for the former; but when the patient, the disease, and
the physician ( guru) are on one, and that the wrong, side, then nothing can save  him from a descent on that
downward path which it is the object of the  sadhana to prevent. Verse 67 in Chapter I. of this Tantra is here
in point.
Owing, however, to abuses, particularly as regards the tattva  of madya and maithuna, this Tantra, according
to  the current version, prescribes in certain cases, limitations as  regards their use. It prescribes that when the
Kaliyuga is in  full strength, and in the case of householders (grihastha) whose minds are engrossed with
worldly affairs, the "three sweets" ( madhuratraya) are to be substituted for wine. Those who are  of virtuous
temperament, and whose minds are turned towards the  Brahman, are permitted to take five cups of wine. So
also as regards  maithuna, this Tantra states that men in this Kali age are  by their nature weak and disturbed
by lust, and by reason of this do  not recognize woman (shakti) to be the image of the  Deity. It accordingly
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Panchatattva
45

ordains that when the Kaliyuga is in full  sway, the fifth tattva shall only be accomplished with  sviyashakti, or
the worshipperÕs own wife, and that union  with a woman who is not married to the sadhaka in either
Brahma or Shaiva form is forbidden. In the case of other  shakti (parakiya and sadharani) it prescribes,  in lieu
of maithuna, meditation by the worshipper upon  the lotus feet of the Devi, together with japa of his
ishtamantra. This rule, however, the Commentator says, is  not of universal application. Shiva has, in this
Tantra, prohibited  sadhana with the last tattva, with parakiya, and sadharani shakti, in the case of men of
ordinary  weak intellect ruled by lust; but for those who have by sadhana  conquered their passions and
attained the state of a true vira, or siddha, there is no prohibition as to the mode of  latasadhana. This Tantra
appears to be, in fact, a protest  against the misuse of the tattwa, which had followed upon  a relaxation of the
original rules and conditions governing them.  Without the panchatattva in one form or another, the
shaktipuja cannot be performed. The Mother of the Universe must be  worshipped with these elements. By
their use the universe ( jagatbrahmanda) itself is used as the article of worship.  Wine signifies the power
(shakti) which produces all  fiery elements; meat and fish all terrestrial and aquatic animals;  mudra all
vegetable life; and maithuna the will (ichchha ) action (kriya) and knowledge (jnana) shakti of the Supreme
Prakriti productive of that great pleasure  which accompanies the process of creation. To the Mother is thus
offered the restless life of Her universe.
The object of all sadhana is the stimulation of the  sattvaguna. When by such sadhana this guna largely
preponderates, the sattvika sadhana suitable for men of a high  type of divyabhava is adopted. In this latter
sadhana the  names of the panchatattva are used symbolically for operations  of a purely mental and spiritual
character. Thus, the Kaivalya says  that "wine" is that intoxicating knowledge acquired by yoga of  the
Parabrahman, which renders the worshipper senseless as regards the  external world. Meat (mangsa) is not
any fleshly thing,  but the act whereby the sadhaka consigns all his acts to Me ( Mam). Matsya (fish) is that
sattvika knowledge by  which through the sense of "mineness" the worshipper sympathizes with  the pleasure
and pain of all beings. Mudra is the act of  relinquishing all association with evil which results in bondage,
and  maithuna is the union of the Shakti Kundalini with Shiva in the  body of the worshipper. This, the Yogini
Tantra says, is the best of  all unions for those who have already con−trolled their passions ( yati). According
to the Agamasara, wine is the somadhara , or lunar ambrosia, which drops from the brahmarandhra; Mangsa
(meat) is the tongue (ma), of which its part (angsha) is speech. The sadhaka, in "eating" it, controls his
speech. Matsya (fish) are those two which are constantly moving  in the two rivers Ida and Pingala. He who
controls his breath by  pranayama (q.v.), "eats" them by kumbhaka. Mudra is  the awakening of knowledge in
the pericarp of the great sahasrara  Lotus, where the Atma, like mercury, resplendent as ten  million suns, and
deliciously cool as ten million moons, is united with  the Devi Kundalini. The esoteric meaning of maithuna is
thus  stated by the Agama: The ruddy−hued letter Ra is in the Kunda , and the letter Ma, in the shape of
vindu, is in the mahayoni. When Makara (m), seated on  the Hangsa in the form of Akara (a), unites with
rakara (r), then the Brahmajnana, which is the source  of supreme Bliss, is gained by the sadhaka, who is
then  called atmarama, for his enjoyment is in the Atma. in the sahasrara. This is the union on the purely
sattvika plane, which corresponds on the rajasika plane to  the union of Shiva and Shakti in the persons of
their worshippers.
The union of Shiva and Shakti is described as a true yoga, from which, as the Yamala says, arises that joy
which is known as the  Supreme Bliss.
Chakrapuja
Worship with the panchatattva generally takes place in an  assembly called a chakra, which is composed of
men ( sadhaka) and women (shakti), or Bhairava  and Bhairavi. The worshippers sit in a circle (chakra ), men
and women alternately, the shakti sitting on the  left of the sadhaka. The Lord of the chakra
( chakrasvamin, or chakreshvara) sits with his  Shakti in the centre, where the wine−jar and other articles
used in the  worship are kept. During the chakra all eat, drink, and worship  together, there being no distinction
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chakrapuja
46

of caste. No pashu should,  however, be introduced. There are various kinds of chakra, such as the
Vira, Raja, Deva, Maha  Chakras  productive, it is said, of various fruits for the participators  therein. Chapter
VI. of the Mahanirvvana Tantra deals with the  panchatattva, and Chapter VIII. gives an account of the
Bhairavi and Tattva (or Divya) chakras. The latter is for worshippers of the Brahma−Mantra.
Yoga
This word, derived from the root Yuj ("to join"), is in  grammar sandhi, in logic avayavashakti, or  the power
of the parts taken together, and in its most widely known and  present sense the union of the jiva, or embodied
spirit,  with the Paramatma, or Supreme Spirit, and the practices  by which this union may be attained. There
is a natural yoga, in which all beings are, for it is only by virtue of this identity in  fact that they exist. This
position is common ground, though in  practice too frequently overlooked. "Primus modus unionis est, quo
Deus, ratione suæ immensitatis est in omnibus rebus per essentiam,  præsentiam, et potentiam; per essentiam
ut dans omnibus esse; per  præsentiam ut omnia prospiciens; per potentiam ut de omnibus  disponens." The
mystical theologian cited, however, proceeds to say:  "Sed hæc unio animæ cum Deo est generalis, communis
omnibus et ordinis  naturalis . . . illa namque de qua loquimur est ordinis supernaturalis  actualis et fructiva." It
is of this special yaga, though  not in reality more "supernatural" than the first, that we here deal.  Yoga in its
technical sense is the realization of this identity,  which exists, though it is not known, by the destruction of
the false  appearance of separation. "There is no bond equal in strength to maya , and no force greater to
destroy that bond than yoga. There is no better friend than knowledge (jnana), nor  worse enemy than egoism
(ahangkara). As to learn the  Shastra one must learn the alphabet, so yoga is necessary for  the acquirement of
tattvajnana (truth)." The animal body is the  result of action, and from the body flows action, the process
being  compared to the seesaw movement of a ghatiyantra, or  water−lifter. Through their actions beings
continually go from birth to  death. The complete attainment of the fruit of yoga is lasting  and unchanging life
in the noumenal world of the Absolute.
Yoga 
is variously named according to the methods employed, but the two  main divisions are those of the hathayoga
(or ghatasthayoga ) and samadhi yoga, of which raja−yoga is  one of the forms. Hathayoga is commonly
misunderstood, both in  its definition and aim being frequently identified with exaggerated  forms of
self−mortification. 
The Gherandasanghita well defines it to be "the means whereby the  excellent rajayoga is attained." Actual
union is not the result  of Hathayoga alone, which is concerned with certain physical  processes preparatory or
auxiliary to the control of the mind, by which  alone union may be directly attained. It is, however, not meant
that  all the processes of Hathayoga here or in the books described  are necessary for the attainment of
rajayoga. What is  necessary must be determined according to the circumstances of each  particular case. What
is suited or necessary in one case may not be so  for another. A peculiar feature of Tan−trika virachara is the
union of the sadhaka and his shakti in latasadhana. This is a process which is expressly forbidden to Pashus
by the  same Tantras which prescribe it for the vira. The union  of Shiva and Shakti in the higher sadhana is
different in form, being  the union of the Kundalini Shakti of the Muladhara with the Vindu which  is upon the
Sahasrara. This process, called the piercing of the six  chakra, is described later on in a separate paragraph.
Though, however, all Hathayoga processes are not necessary,  some, at least, are generally considered to be
so. Thus, in the  well−known ashtangayoga (eight−limbed yoga), of which samadhi  is the highest end, the
physical conditions and processes known as  asana and pranayama (vide post) are prescribed.
This yoga prescribes five exterior (vahiranga) methods for the subjugation of the body  namely (1)
Yama, forbearance or self−control, such as sexual continence, avoidance of  harm to others
(ahingsa), kindness, forgiveness, the  doing of good without desire for reward, absence of covetousness,
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

temperance, purity of mind and body, etc. (2) Niyama, religious observances, charity, austerities, reading of
the Shastra  and Ishvara Pranidhana, persevering devotion to the Lord.  (3) Asana, seated positions or
postures (vide post ). (4) Pranayama, regulation of the breath. A  yogi renders the vital airs equable, and
consciously produces the  state of respiration which is favourable for mental concentration, as  others do it
occasionally and unconsciously (vide post). (5) Pratyahara, restraint of the senses, which follow in  the path
of the other four processes which deal with the subjugation of  the body. There are then three interior
(yogangga) methods for the subjugation of the mind  namely (6) Dharana, attention, steadying of the mind,
the fixing of the internal organ ( chitta) in the particular manner indicated in the works on  yoga. (7) Dhyana
or the uniform continuous contemplation of the  object of thought; and (8) that samadhi which is called
savikalpasamadhi. Savikalpasamadhi is a deeper and more  intense contemplation on the Self to the exclusion
of all other  objects, and constituting trance or ecstasy. This ecstasy is perfected  to the stage of the removal of
the slightest trace of the distinction  of subject and object in nirvikalpasamadhi, in which  there is complete
union with the Paramatma, or Divine Spirit. By  vairagya (dispassion), and keeping the mind in its
unmodified  state, yoga is attained. This knowledge, Ahang Brahmasmi  ("I am the Brahman"), does not
produce liberation (moksha), but is  liberation itself, Whether yoga is spoken of as the union of  Kulakundalini
with Paramashiva, or the union of the individual soul ( jivatma) with the Supreme Soul (paramatma), or  as
the state of mind in which all outward thought is suppressed, or as  the controlling or suppression of the
thinking faculty (chittavritti ), or as the union of the moon and the sun (Ida and Pingala), Prana and Apana,
Nada and Vindu, the meaning and the end are in each  case the same.
Yoga
, in seeking mental control and concentration, makes use of  certain preliminary physical processes
(sadhana), such as  the shatkarmma, asana, mudra, and  pranayama. By these four processes and three mental
acts,  seven qualities, known as shodhana, dridhata, sthirata , dhairyya, laghava, pratyaksha, nirliptatva  (vide
post), are acquired. 
Shodhana: Shatkarmma
The first, or cleansing, is effected by the six processes known as  the shatkarmma. Of these, the first is
Dhauti, or washing, which is fourfold, or inward washing (antar−dhauti), cleansing of the teeth, etc.
(dantadhauti) of the  "heart" (hriddhauti), and of the rectum ( muladhauti). Antardhauti is also fourfold
namely,  vatasara, by which air is drawn into the belly and then  expelled; varisara, by which the body is
filled with  water, which is then evacuated by the anus; vahnisara, in which the nabhi−granthi is made to
touch the spinal column ( meru); and vahishkrita, in which the belly is  by kakinimudra filled with air, which
is retained half a yama , and then sent downward. Dantadhauti is fourfold,  consisting in the cleansing of the
root of the teeth and tongue, the  ears, and the "hollow of the forehead" (kapalarandhra). By hriddhauti
phlegm and bile are removed. This is done by a  stick (dandadhauti) or cloth (vasodhauti) pushed into the
throat, or swallowed, or by vomiting (vamanadhauti ). Mudadhauti is done to cleanse the exit of the
apanavayu  either with the middle finger and water or the stalk of a turmeric  plant.
Vasti
, the second of the shatkarmma, is twofold,  and is either of the dry (shuska) or watery (jala) kind. In the
second form the yogi sits in the utkatasana  posture in water up to the navel, and the anus is contracted and
expanded by ashvini mudra; or the same is done in the  pashchimottanasana, and the abdomen below the
navel is  gently moved. In neti the nostrils are cleansed with a piece of  string. Lauliki is the whirling of the
belly from side to side.  In trataka the yogi, without winking, gazes at  some minute object until the tears start
from his eyes. By this the  "celestial vision" (divya drishti) so often referred to in the  Tantrika upasana is
acquired. Kapalabhati is a process for  the removal of phlegm, and is threefold  vatakrama by inhalation  and
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Shodhana: Shatkarmma
48

exhalation; vyutkrama by water drawn through the nostrils  and ejected through the mouth; and shitkrama the
reverse process. 
These are the various processes by which the body is cleansed and  made pure for the yoga practice to follow.
Dridhata: Asana
Dridhata, or strength or firmness, the acquisition of which is the  second of the above−mentioned processes, is
attained by asana.
Asana 
are postures of the body. The term is generally described as modes  of seating the body. But the posture is not
necessarily a sitting one;  for some asana are done on the belly, back, hands, etc. It is  said that the asana are
as numerous as living beings, and that  there are 8,400,000 of these; 1,600 are declared to be excellent, and
out of these thirty−two are auspicious for men, which are described in  detail. Two of the commonest of these
are muktapadmasana ("the  loosened lotus seat"), the ordinary position for worship, and
baddhapadmasana. Patanjali, on the subject of asana, merely points out what are good conditions, leaving
each one to  settle the details for himself according to his own requirements. There  are certain other
asana, which are peculiar to the  Tantras, such as munddasana, chitasana, and  shavasana, in which skulls,
the funeral pyre, and a corpse  respectively form the seat of the sadhaka. These, though  they may have other
ritual objects, form part of the discipline for the  conquest of fear and the attainment of indifference, which is
the  quality of a yoga. And so the Tantras pre−scribe as the  scene of such rites the solitary mountain−top, the
lonely empty house  and river−side, and the cremation−ground. The interior cremation−ground  is there
where the kamik body and its passions are consumed in the fire  of knowledge. 
Sthirata: Mudra
Sthirata, or fortitude, is acquired by the practice of  the mudra. The mudra dealt with in works of  hathayoga
are positions of the body. They are gymnastic,  health−giving, and destructive of disease, and of death, such as
the  jaladhara and other mudra. They also preserve from  injury by fire, water, or air. Bodily action and the
health resulting  therefrom react upon the mind, and by the union of a perfect mind and  body siddhi is by their
means attained. The Gheranda Sanghita  describes a number of mudra, of which those of importance  may be
selected. In the celebrated yonimudra the yogi in  siddhasana stops with his fingers the ears, eyes, nostrils, and
mouth. He inhales pranavayu by kakinimudra, and  unites it with apanavayu. Meditating in their order upon
the six chakra, he arouses the sleeping Kulakundalini by  the mantra "Hung Hangsah," and raises Her to the
Sahasrara; then, deeming himself pervaded with the Shakti,  and in blissful union (sanggama) with Shiva, he
meditates  upon himself, as by reason of that union Bliss itself and the Brahman.  Ashvinimudra consists of the
repeated contraction and expansion of  the anus for the purpose of shodhana or of contraction to  restrain the
apana in Skatchakrabheda. Shaktichalana  employs the latter mudra, which is repeated until vayu  manifests
in the sushumna. The process is accompanied by  inhalation and the union of prana and apana whilst in
siddhasana.
Dhairya: Pratyahara
Dhairya, or steadiness, is produced by pratyahara . Pratyahara is the restraint of the senses, the freeing of
the  mind from all distractions, and the keeping of it under the control of  the Atma. The mind is withdrawn
from whatsoever direction  it may tend by the dominant and directing Self. Pratyahara  destroys the six sins.

Laghava: Pranayama
From pranayama (q.v.) arises laghava  (lightness).
All beings say the ajapa Gayatri, which is the  expulsion of the breath by Hangkara, and its inspiration  by
Sahkara, 21,600 times a day. Ordinarily, the breath  goes forth a distance of 12 fingerÕs breadth, but in
singing, eating,  walking, sleeping, coition, the distances are 16, 20, 24, 30, and 36  breadths respectively. In
violent exercise these distances are  exceeded, the greatest distance being 96 breadths. Where the breathing  is
under the normal distance, life is prolonged. Where it is above  that, it is shortened. Puraka is inspiration, and
rechaka  expira−tion. Kumbhaka is the retention of breath between these  two movements. Kumbhaka is,
according to the Gheranda Sanghita  of eight kinds: sahita, suryyabheda, ujjayi,
shitali, bhastrika, bhramari, murchchha, and kevali. Pranayama similarly varies. Pranayama  is the control of
the breath and other vital airs. It awakens shakti , frees from disease, produces detachment from the world,
and  bliss. It is of varying values, being the best (uttama) where the measure is 20; middling
(madhyama) when at 16  it produces spinal tremor; and inferior (adhama) when at  12 it induces perspiration.
It is necessary that the nadi should  be cleansed, for air does not enter those which are impure. The  cleansing
of the nadi (nadi−shuddhi) is either samauÇ  or nirmanu  that is, with or without, the use of vija. According to
the first form, the yogi in padmasana does  gurunyasa according to the directions of the guru. Meditating on
"yang," he does japa through Ida of  the vija 16 times, kumbhaka with japa of vija  64 times, and then
exhalation through the solar nadi and japa  of vija 32 times. Fire is raised from manipura and united  with
prithivi. Then follows inhalation by the solar  nadu with the vahni vija 16 times, kumbhaka with 64  japa of
the vija, followed by exhalation through the  lunar nadi and japa of the vija 32 times. He then  meditates on the
lunar brilliance, gazing at the tip of the nose. and  inhales by Ida with japa of the vija "thang" 16 times.
Kumbhaka is done with the vija vang 64 times.  He then thinks of himself as flooded by nectar, and considers
that the  nadi have been washed. He exhales by Pingala with 32 japa of  the vija lang, and considers himself
thereby as  strengthened. He then takes his seat on a mat of kusha grass, a  deerskin, etc., and, facing east or
north, does pranayama. For its exercise there must be, in addition to nadi shuddhi, consideration of proper
place, time, and food. Thus, the place should  not be so distant as to induce anxiety, nor in an unprotected
place,  such as a forest, nor in a city or crowded locality, which induces  distraction. The food should be pure,
and of a vegetarian character. It  should not be too hot or too cold, pungent, sour, salt, or bitter.  Fasting, the
taking of one meal a day, and the like, are prohibited. On  the contrary, the Yogi should not remain without
food for more than one  yama (three hours). The food taken should be light and  strengthening. Long walks
and other violent exercise should be avoided,  as also  cer−tainly in the case of beginners  sexual intercourse.
The  stomach should only be half filled. Yoga should be commenced, it  is said, in spring or autumn. As stated,
the forms of pranayama  vary. Thus, sahita, which is either with (sagarbha) or without (nirgarbha) vija, is,
according to  the former form, as follows: The sadhaka meditates on Vidhi  (Brahma), who is full of
rajoguna, red in colour, and the  image of akara. He inhales by Ida in six measures ( matra). Before
kumbhaka he does the uddiyanabandha  mudra. Meditating on Hari (Vishnu) as sattvamaya and  the black vija
ukara, he does kumbhaka with 64  japa of the vija; then, meditating on Shiva as  tamomaya and his white vija
makara, he exhales  through Pingala with 32 japa of the vija; then,  inhaling by Pingala, he does
kumbhaka, and exhales by Ida  with the same vija. The process is repeated in the normal  and reversed order.
Pratyaksha: Dhyana
Through dhyana is gained the third quality of realization or  pratyaksha. Dhyana, or meditation, is of three
kinds:  (1) sthula, or gross; (2) jyotih; (3)  sukshma, or subtle. In the first the form of the Devata is brought
before the mind. One form of dhyana for this purpose is as  follows: Let the sadhana think of the great ocean
of nectar in  his heart. In the middle of that ocean is the island of gems, the  shores of which are made of
powdered gems. The island is clothed with a  kadamba forest in yellow blossom. This forest is surrounded by
Malati, Champaka, Parijata, and other fragrant  trees. In the midst of the Kadamba forest there rises the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Laghava: Pranayama
50

beautiful Kalpa tree, laden with fresh blossom and fruit. Amidst  its leaves the black bees hum and the koel
birds make love. Its four  branches are the four Vedas. Under the tree there is a great mandapa  of precious
stones, and within it a beautiful bed, on which let him  picture to himself his Ishtadevata. The Guru will  direct
him as to the form, raiment, vahana, and the title  of the Devata. Jyotirdhyana is the infusion of fire and life
( tejas) into the form so imagined. In the muladhara  lies the snake−like Kundalini. There the jivatma, as it
were the tapering flame of a candle, dwells. The sadhaka then  meditates upon the tejomaya Brahman, or,
alternatively, between  the eyebrows on pranavatmaka, the flame emitting its  lustre.
Sukshmadhyana 
is meditation on Kundalini with sham−bhavi mudra after She  has been roused. By this yoga (vide post) the
atma is revealed (atmasakshatkara).
Nirliptatva: Samadhi
Lastly, through samadhi the quality of nirliptatva, or detachment, and thereafter mukti (liberation) is attained.
Samadhi considered as a process is intense mental con−centration,  with freedom from all sangkalpa, and
attachment to the  world, and all sense of "mineness," or self−interest (mamata). Considered as the result of
such process it is the union of Jiva  with the Paramatma.
Forms Of Samadhi Yoga 
This samadhi yoga is, according to the Gheranda Sanghita, of  six kinds. (1) Dhyanayogasamadhi, attained by
shambhavi mudra, in which, after meditation on the  Vindu−Brahman and realization of the Atma
(atmapratyaksha ), the latter is resolved into the Mahakasha. (2)  Nadayoga, attained by khechari mudra, in
which  the frenum of the tongue is cut, and the latter is lengthened  until it reaches the space between the
eyebrows, and is then introduced  in a reversed position into the mouth. (3) Rasanandayoga, attained by
kumbhaka, in which the sadhaka in a  silent place closes both ears and does puraka and kumbhaka  until he
hears the word nada in sounds varying in strength from  that of the cricketÕs chirp to that of the large
kettledrum. By daily  practice the anahata sound is heard, and the jyotih with  the manas therein is seen, which
is ultimately dissolved in the  supreme Vishnu. (4) Layasiddhiyoga, accomplished by the  celebrated
yonimudra already described. The sadhaka, thinking of himself as Shakti and the Paramatma as Purusha,
feels  himself in union (sanggama) with Shiva, and enjoys with  him the bliss which is shringararasa, and
becomes Bliss  itself, or the Brahman. (5) Bhakti Yoga, in which  meditation is made on the Ishtadevata with
devotion (bhakti ) until, with tears flowing from the excess of bliss, the  ecstatic condition is attained. (6)
Rajayoga, accomplished by aid of the manomurchchha kumbhaka. Here  the manas detached from all worldly
objects is fixed between the  eyebrows in the ajnachakra, and Kumbhaka is done.  By the union of the manas
with the atma, in which  the jnani sees all things, rajayogasamadhi is attained.
Shatchakra−bheda
The piercing of the six chakra is one of the most important  subjects dealt with in the Tantras, and is part of
the practical  yaga process of which they treat. Details of practice can only be  learnt from a Guru, but
generally it may be said that the  particular is raised to the universal life, which as chit is  realizable only in the
sahasrara in the following manner: The  jivatma in the subtle body, the receptacle of the five vital airs
( pancha prana), mind in its three aspects of manas, ahangkara, and buddhi; the five organs of  action
(panchakarmendriya) and the five organs of  perception (panchajnanendriya) is united with the
Kulakundalini. The Kandarpa or Kama Vayu in the  muladhara a form of the Apana Vayu is given a leftward
revolution and the fire which is round Kundalini is kindled. By the  vija "Hung," and the heat of the fire thus
kindled,  the coiled and sleeping Kundalini is wakened. She who lay asleep around  svayambhu−linga, with
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Nirliptatva: Samadhi
51

her coils three circles and a half  closing the entrance of the brahma−dvara, will, on being  roused, enter that
door and move upwards, united with the jivatma .
On this upward movement, Brahma, Savitri, Dakini−Shakti, the Devas,  vija, and vritti, are dissolved in the
body of Kundalini. The  Mahimandala or prithivi is converted into the vija " Lang," and is also merged in Her
body. When Kundalini leaves  the muladhara, that lotus which, on the awakening of  Kundalini had opened
and turned its flower upwards, again closes and  hangs down−wards. As Kundalini reaches the
svadhishthana−chakra, that lotus opens out, and lifts its flower upwards. Upon the  entrance of Kundalini,
Mahavishnu, Mahalakshmi, Sarasvati, Rakini  Shakti, Deva, Matrikas, and vritti, Vaikunthadhama,
Golaka, and the Deva and Devi residing therein are dissolved in the body of  Kundalini. The prithivi, or
"earth" vija "Lang ," is dissolved in apas, and apas converted  into the vija vang remains in the body of
Kundalini. When the  Devi reaches the manipura chakra all that is in the chakra  merges in Her body. The
Varuna vija "vang" is  dissolved in fire, which remains in the body of the Devi as the Vija  "rang." This chakra
is called the  Brahma−granthi (or knot of Brahma). The piercing of this chakra  may involve considerable
pain, physical disorder, and even disease. On  this account the directions of an experienced Guru are
necessary, and therefore also other modes of yoga have been recommended  for those to whom they are
applicable: for in such modes activity is  provoked directly in the higher centre and it is not necessary that the
lower chakras should be pierced. Kundalini next reaches the  anahata chakra, where all which is therein is
merged in Her.  The vija of Tejas, "rang," disappears in Vayu and Vayu converted into its vija "Yang"  merges
into the body of Kundalini. This chakra is known as  Vishnu−granthi (knot of Vishnu). Kundalini then
ascends to the  abode of Bharati (or Sarasvati) or the vishuddha chakra. Upon Her entrance,
Arddha−narishvara Shiva, Shakini, the  sixteen vowels, mantra, etc., are dissolved in the body  of Kundalini.
The vija of Vayu, "yang," is dissolved in akasha, which itself being transformed  into the vija "hang," is
merged in the body of  Kundalini. Piercing the lalana chakra, the Devi reaches  the ajnachakra, where Parama
Shiva, Siddha−Kali, the  Deva, guna, and all else therein, are absorbed into Her body. The  vija of
akasha, "Hang," is merged in  the manas chakra, and mind itself in the body of  Kundalini. The ajnachakra is
known as Rudra−granthi (or  knot of Rudra or Shiva). After this chakra has been pierced,  Kundalini of Her
own motion unites with Parama Shiva. As She proceeds  upwards from the two−petalled lotus, the niralamba
puri, pranava, nada, etc., are merged in Her.
The Kundalini has then in her progress upwards absorbed in herself  the twenty−four tattva commencing with
the gross elements, and  then unites Herself and becomes one. with Parama Shiva. This is the  maithuna
(coition) of the sattvika−pancha−tattva. The  nectar which flows from such union floods the
kshudrabrahmanda  or human body. It is then that the sadhaka, forgetful of  all in this world, is immersed in
ineffable bliss.
Thereafter the sadhaka, thinking of the vayu vija  "yang" as being in the left nostril, inhales through Ida,
making japa of the vija sixteen times. Then, closing both  nostrils, he makes japa of the vija sixty−four times.
He  then thinks that the black "man of sin" (Papapurusha) in  the left cavity of the abdomen is being dried up
(by air), and so  thinking he exhales through the right nostril Pingala, making japa  of the vija thirty−two
times. The sadhaka then meditating  upon the red−coloured vija "rang" in the  manipura, inhales, making
sixteen japa of the vija , and then closes the nostrils, making sixteen japa. While making the japa he thinks
that the body of "the man of  sin" is being burnt and reduced to ashes (by fire). He then exhales  through the
right nostril with thirty−two japa. He then  meditates upon the white chandravija "thang." He next  inhales
through Ida, making japa of the vija sixteen  times, closes both nostrils with japa done sixty−four times, and
exhales through Pingala with thirty−two japa. During  inhalation, holding of breath, and exhalation, he should
consider that  a new celestial body is being formed by the nectar (composed of all the  letters of the alphabet,
matrika−varna) dropping from the  moon. In a similar way with the vija "vang," the  formation of the body is
continued, and with the vija "lang " it is completed and strengthened. Lastly, with the mantra  "SoÕhang," the
sadhaka leads the jivatma  into the heart. Thus Kundalini, who has enjoyed Her union with  Paramashiva, sets
out on her return journey the way she came. As she  passes through each of the chakra all that she has
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Nirliptatva: Samadhi
52

absorbed  therefrom come out from herself and take their several places in the  chakra.
In this manner she again reaches the muladhara, when  all that is described to be in the chakras (see pp.
lvii−lxiii)  are in the positions which they occupied before her awakening.
The Guru's instructions are to go above the  ajna−chakra, but no special directions are given; for after  this
chakra has been pierced the sadhaka can reach the  brahmasthana unaided. Below the "seventh month of
Shiva" the  relationship of Guru and sishya ceases. The instructions  of the seventh amnaya is not expressed
(aprakashita).
Sin and Virtue
According to Christian conceptions, sin is a violation of the  personal will of, and apostasy from, God. The
flesh is the source of  lusts which oppose God's commands, and in this lies its positive  significance for the
origin of a bias of life against God. According to  St. Thomas, in the original state, no longer held as the
normal, the  lower powers were subordinate to reason, and reason subject to God.  "Original sin" is formally a
"defect of original righteousness," and  materially "concupiscence." As St. Paul says (Rom. vii. 8, 14), the
pneumatic law, which declares war on the lusts, meets with opposition  from the "law in the members." These
and similar notions involve a  religious and moral conscious judgment which is assumed to exist in  humanity
alone. Hindu notions of papa (wrong) and punya  (that which is pure, holy, and right) have a wider content.
The latter  is accordance and working with the will of Ishvara (of whom the jiva  is itself the embodiment), as
manifested at any particular time in the  general direction taken by the cosmic process, as the former is the
contrary. The two terms are relative to the state of evolution and the  surrounding circumstances of the jiva to
which they are applied.  Thus, the impulse towards individuality which is necessary and just on  the path of
inclination or "going forth" (pra−vritti marga), is wrongful as a hindrance to the attainment of unity, which is
the  goal of the path of return (nivritti marga) where  inclinations should cease. In short, what makes for
progress on the one  path is a hindrance on the other. The matter, when rightly undertsood,  is not (except,
perhaps, sometimes popularly) viewed from the juristic  standpoint of an external Lawgiver, His commands,
and those subject to  it, but from that in which the exemplification of the moral law is  regarded as the true and
proper expression of the jiva's  own evolution. Morality, it has been said, is the true nature of a  being. For the
same reason wrong is its destruction. What the jiva  actually does is the result of his karmma. Further, the
term jiva, though commonly applicable to the human  embodiment of the atma, is not limited to it. Both  papa
and punya may therefore be manifested in beings of a  lower rank than that of humanity in so far as what they
(whether  consciously or unconsciously) do is a hindrance to their true  development. Thus, in the Yoga
Vashishtha it is said that even a  creeping plant acquired merit by association with the holy muni  on whose
dwelling it grew. Objectively considered, sin is concisely  defined as duhkhajanakam papam. It is that which
has  been, is, and will be the cause of pain, mental or physical, in past,  present, and future births. The pain as
the consequence of the action  done need not be immediate. Though, however, the suffering may be
experienced as a result later than the action of which it is the cause,  the consequence of the action is not really
something separate, but a  part of the action itself  namely, that part of it which belongs to the  future. The six
chief sins are kama, krodha, lobha, moha, mada, matsaryya  lust, anger, covetousness,  ignorance or delusion,
pride and envy.
All wrong is at base self−seeking, in ignorance or disregard of the  unity of the Self in all creatures. Virtue
(punya), therefore, as the contrary of sin, is that which is the cause of  happiness (sukhajanakam
punyam). That happiness is  produced either in this or future births, or leads to the enjoyment of  heaven
(Svarga). Virtue is that which leads towards the  unity whose substance is Bliss (ananda). This good  karmma
produces pleasant fruit, which, like all the results of  karmma, is transitory. As Shruti says: "It is not by  acts or
the pindas offered by one's children or by wealth, but by  renunciation that men have attained liberation." It is
only by escape  from karmma through knowledge, that the jiva becoming one  with the unchanging Absolute
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Sin and Virtue
53

attains lasting rest. It is obvious that  for those who obtain such release neither vice nor virtue, which are
categories of phenomenal being, exist.
Karmma
Karmma is action, its cause, and effect. There is no uncaused  action, nor action without effect. The past, the
present, and the  future are linked together as one whole. The ichchha, jnana , and kriya shakti manifest in the
jivatma living  on the worldly plane as desire, knowledge, and action. As the  Brihadaranyaka Upanishad says:
"Man is verily formed of desire. As is  his desire, so is his thought. As is his thought, so is his action. As  is his
action, so is his attainment." These fashion the individual's  Karmma. "He who desires goes by work to the
object on which  his mind is set." "As he thinks, so he becometh." Then, as to action,  "whatsoever a man sows
that shall he reap." The matter is not one of  punishment and reward, but of consequence, and the consequence
of  action is but a part of it. If anything is caused, its result is  caused, the result being part of the original
action, whigh continues,  and is transformed into the result. The jivatma experiences  happiness for his good
acts and misery for his evil ones.
Karmma 
is of three kinds  viz., sanchita karmma  that is, the whole  vast accumulated mass of the unexhausted karmma
of the past,  whether good or bad, which has still to be worked out. This past  karmma is the cause of the
character of the succeeding births, and,  as such, is called sangskara, or vasana. The second form of karmma
is prarabdha, or that  part of the first which is ripe, and which is worked out and bears  fruit in the present
birth. The third is the new karmma, which man is continually making by his present and future actions, and  is
called vartamana and agami. The embodied soul ( jivatma), whilst in the sangsara or phenomenal world, is
by  its nature ever making present karmma and experiencing the past.  Even the Devas themselves are subject
to time and karmma. By his karmma a jiva may become an Indra.
Karmma 
is thus the invisible (adrishta), the product of ordained or  prohibited actions capable of giving bodies. It is
either good or bad,  and together these are called the impurity of action (karmma mala ). Even good action,
when done with a view to its fruit, can  never secure liberation. Those who think of the reward will receive
benefit in the shape of that reward. Liberation is the work of  Shiva−Shakti, and is gained only by
brahmajnana, the  destruction of the will to separate life, and realization of unity with  the Supreme. All
accompanying action must be without thought of self.  With the cessation of desire the tie which binds man to
the sangsara  is broken. 
According to the Tantra, the sadhana and achara (q .v.) appropriate to an individual depends upon his
karmma. A man's tendencies, character, and temperament is  moulded by his sanchita karmma. As regards
prarabdha−karmma, it is unavoidable. Nothing can be done but  to work it out. Some systems prescribe the
same method for men of  divers tendencies. But the Tantra recognizes the force of karmma, and moulds its
method to the temperament produced by it. The needs  of each vary, as also the methods which will be the
best suited to each  to lead them to the common goal. Thus, forms of worship which are  permissible to the
vira are forbidden to the pashu. The guru must determine that for which the sadhaka is  qualified (adhikara).
Four Aims Of Being
There is but one thing which all seek  happiness  though it be of  differing kinds and sought in different ways.
All forms, whether  sensual, intellectual, or spiritual, are from the Brahman, who is  Itself the Source and
Essence of all Bliss, and Bliss itself ( rasovai sah). Though issuing from the same source  pleasure  differs in
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Karmma
54

its forms in being higher and lower, transitory or durable,  or permanent. Those on the path of desire (pravritti
marga) seek it through the enjoyments of this world (bhukti) or  in the more durable, though still impermanent
delights of heaven ( svarga). He who is on the path of return (nivritti marga ) seeks happiness, not in the
created worlds, but in everlasting  union with their primal source (mukti); and thus it is  said that man can
never be truly happy until he seeks shelter with  Brahman, which is Itself the great Bliss (rasam hyevayam
labdhva  anandi bhavati).
The eternal rhythm of the Divine Breath is outwards from spirit to  matter and inwards from matter to spirit.
Devi as Maya evolves the  world. As Mahamaya She recalls it to Herself. The path of outgoing is  the way of
pravritti; that of return nivritti. Each of these movements is Divine. Enjoyment (bhukti) and  liberation
(mukti) are each Her gifts. And in the third  chapter of the work cited it is said that of Vishnu and Shiva mukti
only can be had, but of Devi both bhukti and mukti; and this is so in so far as the Devi is, in a peculiar sense,
the  source whence those material things come from which enjoyment (bhoga ) arises. All jiva on their way to
humanity, and the bulk  of humanity itself, is on the forward path, and rightly seeks the  enjoyment which is
appropriate to its stage of evolution.
The thirst for life will continue to manifest itself until the point  of return is reached and the outgoing energy
is exhausted. Man must,  until such time, remain on the path of desire. In the hands of Devi is  the noose of
desire. Devi herself is both desire and that light of  knowledge which in the wise who have known enjoyment
lays bare its  futilities. But one cannot renounce until one has enjoyed, and so of  the world−process itself it is
said: that the unborn ones, the  Purushas, are both subservient to Her (prakriti), and  leave Her by reason of
viveka.
Provision is made for the worldly life which is the "outgoing" of  the Supreme. And so it is said that the
Tantrika has both enjoyment ( bhukti) and liberation (mukti). But enjoyment  itself is not without its law.
Desire is not to be let loose without  bridle. The mental self is, as is commonly said, the charioteer of the
body, of which the senses are the horses. Contrary to mistaken notions  on the subject, the Tantras take no
exception to the ordinary rule that  it is necessary not to let them run away. If one would not be swept  away
and lost in the mighty force which is the descent into matter,  thought and action must be controlled by
Dharmma. Hence the  first three of the aims of life (trivarga) on the path of  pravritti are dharmma, artha, and
kama.
Dharmma
Dharmma means that which is to be held fast or kept  law,  usage, custom, religion, piety, right, equity, duty,
good works, and  morality. It is, in short, the eternal and immutable (sanatana)  principles which hold together
the universe in its parts and in its  whole, whether organic or inorganic matter. "That which supports and  holds
together the peoples (of the universe) is dharmma." "It was declared for well−being and bringeth well−being.
It upholds  and preserves. Because it supports and holds together, it is called  Dharmma. By Dharmma are the
people upheld." It is, in short, not an  artificial rule, but the principle of right living. The mark of  dharmma
and of the good is achara (good conduct), from which  dharmma is born and fair fame is acquired here and
hereafter. The  sages embraced achara as the root of all tapas. Dharmma  is not only the principle of right
living, but also its application.  That course of meritorious action by which man fits himself for this  world,
heaven, and liberation. Dharmma is also the result of  good action  that is, the merit acquired thereby. The
basis of the  sanatana dharmma is revelation (shruti) as presented in the  various Shastra. Smriti, Purana, and
Tantra. In the Devi Bhagavata it  is said that in the Kaliyuga Vishnu in the form of Vyasa divides the  one
Veda into many parts, with the desire to benefit men, and with the  knowledge that they are short−lived and of
small intelligence, and  hence unable to master the whole. This dharmma is the first of  the four leading arms
(chaturvarga) of all being.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Dharmma

Kama
Kama is desire, such as that for wealth, success, family,  position, or other forms of happiness for self or
others. It also  involves the notion of the necessity for the posses−sion of great and  noble aims, desires, and
ambitions, for such possession is the  characteristic of greatness of soul. Desire, whether of the higher or
lower kinds, must, however, be lawful, for man is subject to dharmma , which regulates it.
Artha
Artha (wealth) stands for the means by which this life may be  maintained  in the lower sense, food, drink,
money, house, land, and  other property; and in the higher sense the means by which effect may  be given to
the higher desires, such as that of worship, for which  artha may be necessary, aid given to others, and so
forth. In  short, it is all the necessary means by which all right desire, whether  of the lower or higher kinds,
may be fulfilled. As the desire must be a  right desire  for man is subject to dharmma, which  regulates them  so
also must be the means sought, which are equally so  governed.
This first group is known as the trivarga, which must be  cultivated whilst man is upon the pravritti marga.
Unless and  until there is renunciation on entrance upon the path of return, where  inclination ceases (nivritti
marga), man must work for the  ultimate goal by meritorious acts (dharmma), desires (kama ), and by the
lawful means (artha) whereby the lawful desires  which give birth to righteous acts are realized. Whilst on the
pravritti marga "the trivarga should be equally cultivated,  for he who is addicted to one only is despicable"
(dharmmartha−kamah  samameva sevyah yo hyekasaktah sa jano−jagha−nyah).
Moksha
Of the four aims, moksha or mukti is the truly  ultimate end, for the other three are ever haunted by the fear of
Death  the Ender.
Mukti 
means "loosening" or liberation. It is advisable to avoid the term  "salvation," as also other Christian terms,
which connote different,  though in a loose sense, analogous ideas. According to the Christian  doctrine
(soteriology), faith in Christ's Gospel and in His Church  effects salvation, which is the forgiveness of sins
mediated by  Christ's redeeming activity, saving from judgment, and admitting to the  Kingdom of God. On
the other hand, mukti means a loosening from  the bonds of the sangsara (phenomenal existence), resulting in
a  union (of various degrees of completeness) of the embodied spirit ( jivatma) or individual life with the
Supreme Spirit ( paramatma). Liberation can be attained by spiritual  knowledge (atmajnana) alone, though it
is obvious that  such knowledge must be preceded by, and accompanied with, and, indeed,  can only be
attained in the sense of actual realization, by freedom  from sin and right action through adherence to
dharmma. The idealistic system of Hinduism, which posits the ultimate reality  as being in the nature of mind,
rightly, in such cases, insists on  what, for default of a better term, may be described as the  intellectual, as
opposed to the ethical, nature. Not that it fails to  recognize the importance of the latter, but regards it as
subsidiary  and powerless of itself to achieve that extinction of the modifications  of the energy of
consciousness which constitute the supreme mukti  known as Kaivalya. Such extinction cannot be effected by
conduct alone, for such conduct, whether good or evil, pro−duces  karmma, which is the source of the
modifications which it is  man's final aim to suppress. Moksha belongs to the nitvritti  marga, as the trivarga
appertain to the pravritti  marga. 
There are various degrees of mukti, some more perfect  than the others, and it is not, as is generally supposed,
one state.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Kama
56

There are four future states of Bliss, or pada, being  in the nature of abodes  viz.,
salokya, samipya, sarupya, and sayujya  that is, living in the same  loka, or region, with the Deva worshipped;
being near the  Deva,; receiving the same form or possessing the same aishvaryya  (Divine qualities) as the
Deva, and becoming one with the Deva  worshipped. The abode to which the jiva attains depends upon the
worshipper and the nature of his worship, which may be with, or  without, images, or of the Deva regarded as
distinct from the  worshipper, and with attributes, and so forth. The four abodes are the  result of action,
transitory and conditioned. Mahanirvvana, or Kaivalya, the real moksha, is the result of spiritual  knowledge
(jnana), and is unconditioned and permanent.  Those who know the Brahman, recognizing that the worlds
resulting from  action are imperfect, reject them, and attain to that unconditioned  Bliss which transcends them
all. Kaivalya is the supreme state  of oneness without attributes, the state in which, as the Yogasutra  says,
modification of the energy of consciousness is extinct, and when  it is established in its own real nature.
Liberation is attainable while the body is yet living, in which case  there exists the state of jivanmukti
celebrated in the  Jivanmuktigita of Dattatreya. The soul, it is true, is not really  fettered, and any appearance to
the contrary is illusory. There is, in  fact, freedom, but though moksha is already in possession still,  because of
the illusion that it is not yet attained, means must be  taken to remove the illusion, and the jiva who succeeds
in this  is jivanmukta, though in the body, and is freed from  future embodi−ments. The enlightened Kaula,
according to the  Nitya−nita, sees no difference between mud and sandal, friend and foe,  a dwelling−house
and the cremation−ground. He knows that the Brahman is  all, that the Supreme soul (paramatma) and the
individual  soul (jivatma) are one, and freed from all attachment he is  jivanmukta, or liberated, whilst yet
living. The means whereby  mukti is attained is the yoga process (vide ante).
Siddhi
Siddhi is produced by sadhana. The former term, which  literally means "success," includes accomplishment,
achievement,  success, and fruition of all kinds. A person may thus gain siddhi  in speech, siddhi in mantra,
etc. A person is siddha  also who has perfected his spiritual development. The various powers  attainable
namely, anima, mahima, laghima,  garima, prapti, prakamya, ishitva, vashitva , the powers of becoming
small, great, light, heavy, attaining what one  wills, and the like  are known as the eight siddhi. The
thirty−ninth chapter of the Brahmavaivarta Purana mentions eighteen  kinds, but there are many others,
including such minor accomplishments  as nakhadarpana siddhi or "nail−gazing." The great siddhi is spiritual
perfection. Even the mighty powers of the "eight siddhi " are known as the "lesser siddhi," since the greatest
of all  siddhi is full liberation (mahanirvana) from the bonds of  phenomenal life and union with the
Paramatma, which is the supreme  object (paramartha) to be attained through human birth.

Chapter 1  − Questions relating to the  Liberation of Beings
THE enchanting summit of the Lord of Mountains, resplendent with all  its various jewels, clad with many a
tree and many a creeper, melodious  with the song of many a bird, scented with the fragrance of all the
season's flowers, most beautiful, fanned by soft, cool, and perfumed  breezes, shadowed by the still shade of
stately trees; where cool  groves resound with the sweet−voiced songs of troops of Apsara, and in  the forest
depths flocks of kokila maddened with passion sing; where  (Spring) Lord of the Seasons with his followers
ever abide (the Lord of  Mountains, Kailasa); peopled by (troops of) Siddha, Charana, Gandharva,  and
Ganapatya (1−5). It was there that Parvati, finding Shiva, Her  gracious Lord, in mood serene, with obeisance
bent low and for the  benefit of all the worlds questioned Him, the Silent Deva, Lord of all  things movable and
immovable, the ever Beneficent and ever Blissful  One, the nectar of Whose mercy abounds as a great ocean,
Whose very  essence is the Pure Sattva Guna, He Who is white as camphor and the  Jasmine flower, the
Omnipresent One, Whose raiment is space itself,  Lord of the poor and the beloved Master of all yogi, Whose

coiled and  matted hair is wet with the spray of Ganga and (of Whose naked body)  ashes are the adornment
only; the passionless One, Whose neck is  garlanded with snakes and skulls of men, the three−eyed One, Lord
of  the three worlds, with one hand wielding the trident and with the other  bestowing blessings; easily
appeased, Whose very substance is  unconditioned Knowledge; the Bestower of eternal emancipation, the
Ever−existent, Fearless, Changeless, Stainless, One without defect, the  Benefactor of all, and the Deva of all
Devas (5−10).
Shri Parvati said:
O Deva of the Devas, Lord of the world, Jewel of Mercy, my Husband,  Thou art my Lord, on Whom I am
ever dependent and to Whom I am ever  obedient. Nor can I say ought without Thy word. If Thou hast
affection  for me, I crave to lay before Thee that which passeth in my mind. Who  else but Thee, O Great Lord,
in the three worlds is able to solve these  doubts of mine, Thou Who knowest all and all the Scriptures
(11−13).
Shri Sadashiva said:
What is that Thou sayest, O Thou Great Wise One and Beloved of My  heart, I will tell Thee anything, be it
ever so bound in mystery, even  that which should not be spoken of before Ganesha and Skanda Commander
of the Hosts of Heaven. What is there in all the three worlds which  should be concealed from Thee? For
Thou, O Devi, art My very Self.  There is no difference between Me and Thee. Thou too art omnipresent.
What is it then that Thou knowest not that Thou questionest like unto  one who knoweth nothing (14−16).
The pure Parvati, gladdened at hearing the words of the Deva,  bending low made obeisance and thus
questioned Shangkara.
Shri Adya said:
O Bhagavan! Lord of all, Greatest among those who are versed in  Dharmma, Thou in former ages in Thy
mercy didst through Brahma reveal  the four Vedas which are the propagators of all dharmma and which
ordain the rules of life for all the varying castes of men and for the  different stages of their lives (18−19). In
the First Age, men by the  practice of yaga and yajna prescribed by Thee were virtuous and  pleasing to Devas
and Pitris (20). By the study of the Vedas, dhyana  and tapas, and the conquest of the senses, by acts of mercy
and charity  men were of exceeding power and courage, strength and vigour, adherents  of the true Dharmma,
wise and truthful and of firm resolve, and,  mortals though they were, they were yet like Devas and went to
the  abode of the Devas (21, 22). Kings then were faithful to their  engagements and were ever concerned with
the protection of their  people, upon whose wives they were wont to look as if upon their  mothers, and whose
children they regarded as their very own (23). The  people, too, did then look upon a neighbour's property as if
it were  mere lumps of clay, and, with devotion to their Dharmma, kept to the  path of righteousness (24).
There were then no liars, none who were  selfish, thievish, malicious, foolish, none who were evil−minded,
envious, wrathful, gluttonous, or lustful, but all were good of heart  and of ever blissful mind. Land then
yielded in plenty all kinds of  grain, clouds showered seasonable rains, cows gave abundant milk, and  trees
were weighted with fruits (25−27). No untimely death there was,  nor famine nor sickness. Men were ever
cheerful, prosperous, and  healthy, and endowed with all qualities of beauty and brilliance. Women  were
chaste and devoted to their husbands. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas,  Vaishyas, and Shudras kept to and followed the
customs, Dharmma, yajna,  of their respective castes, and attained the final liberation (28−29).
After the Krita Age had passed away Thou didst in the Treta Age  perceive Dharmma to be in disorder, and
that men were no longer able by  Vedic rites to accomplish their desires. For men, through their anxiety  and
perplexity, were unable to perform these rites in which much  trouble had to be overcome, and for which
much preparation had to be  made. In constant distress of mind they were neither able to perform  nor yet were
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Siddhi
58

willing to abandon the rites.
Having observed this, Thou didst make known on earth the Scripture  in the form of Smriti, which explains
the meaning of the Vedas, and  thus delivered from sin, which is cause of all pain, sorrow, and  sickness, men
too feeble for the practice of tapas and the study of the  Vedas. For men in this terrible ocean of the world,
who is there but  Thee to be their Cherisher, Protector, Saviour, their fatherly  Benefactor, and Lord? (30−33).
Then, in the Dvapara Age when men abandoned the good works  prescribed in the Smritis, and were deprived
of one half of Dharmma and  were afflicted by ills of mind and body, they were yet again saved by  Thee,
through the instructions of the Sanghita and other religious lore  (34−36).
Now the sinful Kali Age is upon them, when Dharmma is destroyed, an  Age full of evil customs and deceit.
Men pursue evil ways. The Vedas  have lost their power, the Smritis are forgotten, and many of the  Puranas,
which contain stories of the past, and show the many ways  (which lead to liberation), will, O Lord! be
destroyed. Men will become  averse from religious rites, without restraint, maddened with pride,  ever given
over to sinful acts, lustful, gluttonous, cruel. heartless,  harsh of speech, deceitful, short−lived,
poverty−stricken, harassed by  sickness and sorrow, ugly, feeble, low, stupid, mean, and addicted to  mean
habits, companions of the base, thievish, calumnious, malicious,  quarrelsome, depraved, cowards, and
ever−ailing, devoid of all sense of  shame and sin and of fear to seduce the wives of others. Vipras will  live
like the Shudras, and whilst neglecting their own Sandhya will yet  officiate at the sacrifices of the low. They
will be greedy, given over  to wicked and sinful acts, liars, insolent, ignorant, deceitful, mere  hangers−on of
others, the sellers of their daughters, degraded, averse  to all tapas and vrata. They will be heretics, impostors,
and think  themselves wise. They will be without faith or devotion, and will do  japa and puja with no other
end than to dupe the people. They will eat  unclean food and follow evil customs, they will serve and eat the
food  of the Shudras and lust after low women, and will be wicked and ready  to barter for money even their
own wives to the low. In short, the only  sign that they are Brahmanas will be the thread they wear.  Observing
no rule in eating or drinking or in other matters, scoffing  at the Dharmma Scriptures, no thought of pious
speech ever so much as  entering their minds, they will be but bent upon the injury of the good  (37−50).
By Thee also have been composed for the good and liberation of men  the Tantras, a mass of Agamas and
Nigamas, which bestow both enjoyment  and liberation, containing Mantras and Yantras and rules as to the
sadhana of both Devis and Devas. By Thee, too, have been described many  forms of Nyasa, such as those
called srishti, sthiti (and  sanghara). By Thee, again, have been described the various seated  positions (of
yoga), such as that of the "tied" and "loosened" lotus,  the Pashu, Vira, and Divya classes of men, as also the
Devata, who  gives success in the use of each of the mantras (50−52). And yet again  it is Thou Who hast
made known in a thousand ways rites relating to the  worship with woman, and the rites which are done with
the use of  skulls, a corpse, or when seated on a funeral pyre (53). By Thee, too,  have been forbidden both
pashu−bhava and divya−bhava. If in this Age  the pashu−bhava cannot exist, how can there be divya−bhava?
(54). For  the pashu must with his own hand collect leaves, flowers, fruits, and  water, and should not look at a
Shudra or even think of a woman (55).  On the other hand, the Divya is all but a Deva, ever pure of heart, and
to whom all opposites are alike, free from attachment to worldly  things, the same to all creatures and
forgiving (56). How can men with  the taint of this Age upon them, who are ever of restless mind, prone  to
sleep and sloth, attain to purity of disposition? (57). By Thee,  too, have been spoken the rites of
Vira−sadhana, relating to the  Pancha−tattva  namely, wine, meat, fish, parched grain, and sexual  union of man
and woman (58−59). But since the men of the Kali Age are  full of greed, lust, gluttony, they will on that
account neglect  sidhana and will fall into sin, and having drunk much wine for the sake  of the pleasure of the
senses, will become mad with intoxication, and  bereft of all notion of right and wrong (61). Some will violate
the  wives of others, others will become rogues, and some, in the  indiscriminating rage of lust, will go
(whoever she be) with any woman  (62). Over eating and drinking will disease many and deprive them of
strength and sense. Disordered by madness, they will meet death,  falling into lakes, pits, or in impenetrable
forests, or from hills or  house−tops (63−64). While some will be as mute as corpses, others will  be for ever
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Siddhi
59

on the chatter, and yet others will quarrel with their  kinsmen and elders. They will be evil−doers, cruel, and
the destroyers  of Dharmma (65−66). I fear, O Lord! that even that which Thou hast  ordained for the good of
men will through them turn out for evil (67).  O Lord of the World! who will practise Yoga or Nyasa, who
will sing the  hymns and draw the Yantra and make Purashcharana? (68). Under the  influences of the Kali
Age man will of his nature become indeed wicked  and bound to all manner of sin (69). Say, O Lord of all the
distressed!  in Thy mercy how without great pains men may obtain longevity, health,  and energy, increase of
strength and courage, learning, intelligence,  and happiness; and how they may become great in strength and
valour,  pure of heart, obedient to parents, not seeking the love of others'  wives, but devoted to their own,
mindful of the good of their  neighbour, reverent to the Devas and to their gurus, cherishers of  their children
and kinsmen (70−72), possessing the knowledge of the  Brahman, learned in the lore of, and ever meditating
on, the Brahman.  Say, O Lord! for the good of the world, what men should or should not  do according to
their different castes and stages of life. For who but  Thee is their Protector in all the three worlds? (73−74).
End of the First Joyful Message, entitled "Questions relating to the  Liberation of Beings."
Chapter 2  − Introduction to the  Worship of Brahman
HAVING heard the words of the Devi, Shangkara, Bestower of happiness  on the world, great Ocean of
mercy, thus of the truth of things spoke.
Sadashiva said:
O Exalted and Holy One! Benefactress of the universe, well has it  been asked by Thee. By none has such an
auspicious question been asked  aforetime (2). Worthy of all thanks art Thou, Who knoweth all good,
Benefactress of all born in this age, O Gentle One! Thou art  Omniscient. Thou knowest the past, present, and
future, and Dharmma.  What Thou hast said about the past, present, and future, and, indeed,  all things, is in
accordance with Dharmma, and is the truth, and is  without a doubt accepted by Me. O Sureshvari! I say unto
you most truly  and without all doubt that men, whether they be of the twice born or  other castes, afflicted as
they are by this sinful Age, and unable to  distinguish the pure from the impure, will not obtain purity or the
success of their desired ends by the Vedic ritual, or that prescribed  by the Sanghitas and Smritis (3−6).
Verily, verily, and yet again  verily, I say unto you that in this Age there is no way to liberation  but that
proclaimed by the Agama (7). I, O Blissful One, have already  foretold in the Vedas, Smritis, and Puranas,'
that in this Age the wise  shall worship after the doctrine of the Agama (8). Verily, verily, and  beyond all
doubt, I say to you that there is no liberation for him who  in this Age, heedless of such doctrine, follows
another (9). There is  no Lord but I in this world, and I alone am He Who is spoken of in the  Vedas, Puranas,
and Smritis and Sanghitas (10). The Vedas and the  Puranas proclaim Me to be the cause of the purity of the
three worlds,  and they who are averse to My doctrine are unbelievers and sinners, as  great as those who slay a
Brahmana (11). Therefore, O Devi! the worship  of him who heeds not My precepts is fruitless, and,
moreover, such an  one goes to hell (12). The fool who would follow other doctrine  heedless of Mine is as
great a sinner as the slayer of a Brahmana or of  a woman, or a parricide; have no doubt of that (13).
In this Age the Mantras of the Tantras are efficacious, yield  immediate fruit, and are auspicious for Japa,
Yajna, and all such  practices and ceremonies (14). The Vedic rites and Mantras which were  efficacious in the
First Age have ceased to be so in this. They are now  as powerless as snakes, the poison−fangs of which are
drawn and are  like to that which is dead (15). The whole heap of other Mantras have  no more power than the
organs of sense of some pictured image on a  wall. To worship with the aid of other Mantras is as fruitless as
it is  to cohabit with a barren woman. The labour is lost (16−17). He who in  this Age seeks salvation by ways
prescribed by others is like a thirsty  fool who digs a well on the bank of the Jahnavi (18), and he who,
knowing My Dharmma, craves for any other is as one who with nectar in  his house yet longs for the
poisonous juice of the akanda plant (19).  No other path is there to salvation and happiness in this life or in
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

that to come like unto that shown by the Tantras (20). From my mouth  have issued the several Tantras with
their sacred legends and practices  both for Siddhas and Sadhakas (21). At times, O My Beloved! by reason  of
the great number of men of the pashu disposition, as also of the  diversity of the qualifications of men, it has
been said that the  Dharmma spoken of in the Kulachara Scriptures should be kept secret  (22). But some
portions of this Dharmma, O Beloved! have been revealed  by Me with the object of inclining the minds of
men thereto. Various  kinds of Devata and worshippers are mentioned therein, such as  Bhairava, Vetala,
Vatuka, Nayika, Shaktas, Shaivas, Vaishnavas, Sauras,  Ganapatyas, and others. In them, too, are described
various Mantra and  Yantra which aid men in the attainment of siddhi, and which, though  they demand great
and constant effort, yet yield the desired fruit  (23−25). Hitherto My answer has been given according to the
nature of  the case and the questioner, and for his individual benefit only (26).
None before has ever questioned Me as Thou hast done for the  advantage of all mankind  nay, for the benefit
of all that breathes,  and that, too, in such detail and with reference to the Dharmma of each  of the different
Ages. Therefore, out of My affection for Thee, O  Parvati! I will speak to Thee of the essence of essences and
of the  Supreme (27−28). O Deveshi! I will state before Thee the very essence  distilled from the Vedas and
Agamas, and in particular from the Tantras  (29). As men versed in the Tantras are to other men, as the
Jahnavi is  to other rivers, as I am to all other Devas, so is the Mahanirvana  Tantra to all other Agamas (30).
O Auspicious One! of what avail are the Vedas, the Puranas, or the  Shastras, since he who has the knowledge
of this great Tantra is Lord  of all Siddhi? (31). Since Thou hast questioned Me for the good of the  world, I
will speak to Thee of that which will lead to the benefit of  the universe (32).
O Parameshvari! should good be done to the universe, the Lord of it  is pleased, since He is its soul, and it
depends on Him (33). He is  One. He is the Ever−existent. He is the Truth. He is the Supreme Unity  without a
second. He is Ever−full and Self−manifest. He is Eternal  Intelligence and Bliss (33−34). He is without
change, Self−existent,  and ever the Same, Serene, above all attributes. He beholds and is the  Witness of all
that passes, Omni−present, the Soul of everything that  is. He, the Eternal and Omnipresent, is hidden and
pervades all things.  Though Himself devoid of sense, He is the Illuminator of all the senses  and their powers
(35−36). The Cause of all the three worlds, He is yet  beyond them and the mind of men. Ineffable and
Omniscient, He knows the  universe, yet none know Him (37). He sways this incompre−hensible  universe,
and all that has movement and is motionless in the three  worlds depends on Him; and lighted by His truth, the
world shines as  does Truth itself. We too have come from Him as our Cause (38−39). He,  the one Supreme
Lord, is the Cause of all beings, the Manifestation of  Whose creative Energy in the three worlds is called
Brahma (40). By His  will Vishnu protects and I destroy, Indra and all other Guardian Devas  of the world
depend on Him and hold rule in their respective regions  under His command. Thou His supreme Prakriti art
adored in all the  three worlds (41−42). Each one does his work by the power of Him who  exists in his heart.
None are ever independent of Him (43). Through  fear of Him the Wind blows, the Sun gives heat, the Clouds
shower  seasonable rain, and the Trees in the forest flower (44).
It is He who destroys Time at the Great Dissolution, of Whom even  Fear and Death itself are afraid. He is
Bhagavan, Who is known as  Yat Tat in the Vedanta (45).O Adored of the Devas! all the Devas  and Devis
nay, the whole universe, from Brahma to a blade of grass  are His forms (46). If He be pleased, the Universe is
pleased. If  aught be done to gratify Him, then the gratification of All is caused  (47). As the pouring of water
at the root of a tree satisfies the wants  of the leaves and branches, so by worshipping Him all the Deathless
Ones are satisfied (48). Just as, O Virtuous One! all the beautiful  Ones are pleased when Thou art worshipped
and when men meditate on and  make Japa and pray to Thee (49). As all rivers must go to the ocean,  so, O
Parvati! all acts of worship must reach Him as the ultimate goal  (50). Whoever be the worshipper, and
whoever be the Devata, he  reverentially worships for some desired end, all that is given to him  through the
Deva he so worships comes from Him as the Supreme (51). Oh,  what use is it to say more before Thee, O My
Beloved?

There is none other but Him to meditate upon, to pray to, to worship  for the attainment of liberation (52).
Need there is none to trouble,  to fast, to torture one's body, to follow rules and customs, to make  large
offerings; need there is none to be heedful as to time nor as to  Nyasa or Mudra, wherefore, O Kuleshani! who
will strive to seek shelter  elsewhere than with Him? (53−54).

Chapter 3  − Description of the  Worship of the Supreme
Brahman
SHRI DEVI said:
O Deva of the Devas, great Deva, Guru of Brihaspati himself, Thou  Who discourseth of all Scriptures,
Mantra, Sadhana, and hast spoken of  the Supreme Brahman by the adoration of Whom mortals attain
happiness  and liberation, do Thou, O Lord! deign to instruct us in the way of  service of the Supreme Soul and
of the observances, Mantra, and  meditation in His worship. It is my desire, O Lord! to hear the  essential
substance of all these from Thee (1−4).
Shri Sadashiva said:
Listen, then, O Beloved of My life! to the most secret and supreme  Truth, the mystery whereof has nowhere
yet been revealed (5).
Because of My affection for Thee I shall speak to Thee of that  Supreme Brahman, Who is ever Existent,
Intelligent, and Who is dearer  to Me than life itself. O Maheshvari! the eternal, intelligent,  infinite Brahman
may be known in Its real Self or by Its external signs  (5−6). That Which is changeless, existent only, and
beyond both mind  and speech, Which shines as the Truth amidst the illusion of the three  worlds, is the
Brahman according to Its real nature (7). That Brahman  is known in samadhi−yoga by those who look upon
all things alike, who  are above all contraries, devoid of doubt, free of all illusion  regarding body and soul (8).
That same Brahman is known from His  external signs, from Whom the whole universe has sprung, in Whom
when  so sprung It exists, and into Whom all things return (9). That which is  known by intuition may also be
perceived from these external signs. For  those who would know Him through these external signs, for them
sadhana  is enjoined (10).
Attend to me, Thou, O dearest One! while I speak to Thee of such  sadhana. And firstly, O Adye! I tell Thee
of the Mantroddhara of the  Supreme Brahman (11). Utter first the Pranava, then the words  "existence" and
"intelligence," and after the word "One" say "Brahman."
MANTRA
Ong Sachchidekam Brahma (12).
This is the Mantra. These words, when combined according to the  rules of Sandhi, form a Mantra of seven
letters. If the Pranava be  omitted, it becomes a Mantra of six letters only (13). This is the most  excellent of all
the Mantras, and the one which immediately bestows  Dharmma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. In the use of this
Mantra there is no  need to consider whether it be efficacious or not, or friendly or  inimical, for no such
considerations affect it (14). Nor at initiation  into this Mantra is it necessary to make calculations as to the
phases  of the Moon, the propitious junction of the stars, or as to the Signs  of the Zodiac. Nor are there any
rules as to whether the Mantra is  suitable or not. Nor is there need of the ten Sangskara. This Mantra is  in
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 3  − Description of the  Worship of the Supreme Brahman
62

every way efficacious in initiation. There is no necessity for  considering anything else (15). Should one have
obtained, through merit  acquired in previous births, an excellent Guru, from whose lips this  Mantra is
received, then life indeed becomes fruitful (16), and the  worshipper receiving in his hands Dharmma, Artha,
Kama, and Moksha,  rejoices both in this world and the next (17).
He whose ears this great jewel of Mantra reaches is indeed blest,  for he has attained the desired end, being
virtuous and pious, and is  as one who has bathed in a the sacred places, been initiated in all  Yajnas, versed in
all Scriptures, and honoured in all the worlds  (18−19). Happy is the father and happy the mother of such a
one  yea,  and yet more than this, his family is hallowed and the gladdened  spirits of the Pitris rejoice with th
Devas, and in the excess of their  joy sing (20): "In our family is born the most excellent of our race,  one
initiate in the Brahma−mantra. What need have we now of pinda  offered at Gaya, or of shraddha, tarpana,
pilgrimage at holy places  (21); of what use are alms, japa, homa, or sadhana, since now we have  obtained
imperishable satisfaction?" (22)
Listen, O Devi! Adored of the world, whilst I tell You the very  truth that for the worshippers of the Supreme
Brahman there is no need  for other religious observances (23). At the very moment of initiation  into this
Mantra the disciple is filled with Brahman, and for such an  one, O Devi! what is there which is unattainable
in all the three  worlds? (24). Against him what can adverse planets or Vetala, Chetaka,  Pishacha, Guhyaka,
Bhuta, the Matrika, Dakini, and other spirits avail?
The very sight of him will drive them to flight with averted faces  (25). Guarded by the Brahma−mantra, clad
with the splendour of Brahman,  he is as it were another Sun. What should he fear, then, from any  planet?
(26). They flee, frightened like elephants at the sight of a  lion, and perish like moths in a flame (27). No sin
can touch, and none  but one as wicked as a suicide can harm, him, who is purified by truth,  without blemish,
a benefactor of all beings, a faithful believer in  Brahman (28). The wicked and sinful who seek to harm him
who is  initiate in the knowledge of the Supreme Brahman do but harm  themselves, for are they not indeed in
essence inseparate from the  ever−existent One? (29). For he is the holy sage and well−wisher,  working for
the happiness of all, and, O Devi! should it be possible to  harm such an one who can go in peace? (31). For
him, however, who has  no knowledge of the meaning of nor of the awakening of the Mantra, it  is fruitless,
even though it were inwardly uttered ten million times  (31).
Listen, then, O My Beloved! while I tell Thee of the meaning and  awakening of Mantra. By the letter A is
meant the Protector of the  world; the letter U denotes its Destroyer; and M stands for its Creator  (32). The
meaning of Sat is Ever−existent; of Chit,  Intelligence; and of Ekam, One without a second. Brahman is so
called because He exists everywhere. Now, O Devi! I have given You the  meaning of the Mantra, which
grants the fulfilment of desires. The  awakening of the Mantra is the knowledge of Him, Who is the pervading
Devata of the Mantra, and such knowledge, O Supreme Devi! yields the  fruit of worship to the worshipper
(35). O Devi! the presiding Devata  of the Mantra is the omnipresent, eternal, inscrutable, formless,
passionless, and ineffable Brahman (36). When introduced by the Vija of  Sarasvati, Maya, or Kamala, instead
of the Mantra Om, it bestows  various kinds of learning, siddhi, and prosperity in every quarter  (37). The
Mantra may be varied either by the prefixing or omitting of  Om, or by the placing of it before each word or
every two words of the  Mantra (38). Sadashiva is the Rishi of this Mantra. The verse is  called Anushtup, and
its presiding Devata is the Supreme Brahman, Who  is without attributeand Who abides in all things. It avails
for the  attainment of Dharmma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha.
Now listen, dear One, whilst I speak to You of Anga−nyasa and  Kara−nyasa (39−40). O great and adorable
Devi! the syllable Om,  the words Sat, Chit, Ekam, Brahma, should be pronounced over the  thumb, the
threatening finger, the middle, nameless, and little fingers  respectively, followed in each case by the words
Namah, Svaha, Vashat,  Hung, and Vaushat; and Ong Sachchidekam Brahma should be said over the  palm
and back of the hand, followed by the Mantra Phat (41, 42).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 3  − Description of the  Worship of the Supreme Brahman
63

The worshipper disciple should in the like manner, with his mind  well under control, perform Anga−nyasa in
accordance with the rules  thereof, commencing with the heart and ending with the hands (43).
After this, whilst reciting the Mantra Om or the Mula−mantra,  Pranayama should be performed thus: He
should close the left nostril  with the middle of the fourth finger, and then inhale through the right  nostril,
meanwhile making japa of the Pranava or the Mula−mantra eight  times. Then, closing the right nostril with
the thumb and shutting also  the mouth, make japa of the Mantra thirty−two times. After that gently  exhale the
breath through the right nostril, doing japa of the Mantra  the while sixteen times.
In the same way perform these three acts with the left nostril, and  then repeat the same process with the right
nostril. O adored of the  Devas! I have now told Thee of the method of Pranayama to be observed  in the use of
the Brahma−Mantra (44−48). The Sadhaka should then make  meditation which accomplishes his desire (49).
DHYANA
In the lotus of my heart I contemplate the Divine Intelligence, the  Brahman without distinctions and
difference, Knowable by Hari, Hara,  and Vidhi, whom Yogis approach in meditation, He Who destroys the
fear  of birth and death, Who is Existence, Intelligence, the Root of all the  three worlds (50)
Having thus contemplated the Supreme Brahman, the worshipper should,  in order to attain union with
Brahman, worship with offerings of his  mind (51). For perfume let him offer to the Supreme Soul the essence
of  the Earth, for flowers the ether, for incense the essence of the air,  for light the Lustre of the universe, and
for food the essence of the  Waters of the world (52). After mentally repeating the great mantra and  offering
the fruit of it to the Supreme Brahman, the excellent disciple  should commence external worship
Meditating with closed eyes on the Eternal Brahman, the worshipper  should with reverence offer to the
Supreme whatever be at hand, such as  perfumes, flowers, clothes, jewels, food, and drink, after having
purified them with the following (54−55):
MANTRA
The vessel in which these offerings are placed is Brahman, and so,  too, is the gheeoffered therein. Brahman is
both the sacrificial Fire  and he who makes the sacrifice, and to Brahman he will attain whose  mind is fixed on
the Brahman by the performance of the rites which lead  to Brahman (56). Then, opening the eyes, and
inwardly and with all his  power making japa with the Mula−mantra, the worshipper should offer the  japa to
Brahman and then recite the hymn that follows and the  Kavacha−mantra (57). Hear, O Maheshvari! the hymn
to Brahman, the  Supreme Spirit, by the hearing whereof the disciple becomes one with  the Brahman (58).
Stotra
Ong! I bow to Thee, the eternal Refuge of all:
I bow to Thee, the pure Intelligence manifested in the universe.
I bow to Thee Who in His essence is One and Who grants liberation.
I bow to Thee, the great, all−pervading attributeless One (59).
Thou art the only Refuge and Object of adoration.
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
DHYANA
64

The whole universe is the appearance of Thee Who art its Cause.
Thou alone art Creator, Preserver, Destroyer of the world.
Thou art the sole immutable Supreme, Who art neither this nor that  (6o);
Dread of the dreadful, Terror of the terrible.
Refuge of all beings, Purificator of all purificators.
Thou alone rulest the high−placed ones,
Supreme over the supreme, Protector of the Protectors (61).
O Supreme Lord in Whom all things are, yet Unmanifest in all,
Imperceptible by the senses, yet the very truth.
Incomprehensible, Imperishable, All−pervading hidden Essence.
Lord and Light of the Universe! save us from harm (62).
On that One alone we meditate, that One alone we in mind worship,
To that One alone the Witness of the Universe we bow.
Refuge we seek with the One Who is our sole Eternal Support,
The Self−existent Lord, the Vessel of safety in the ocean of being  (63).
This is the five−jewelled hymn to the Supreme Soul.
He who pure in mind and body recites this hymn is united with the  Brahman (64). It should be said daily in
the evening, and particularly  on the day of the Moon. The wise man should read and explain it to such  of his
kinsmen as believe in Brahman (65). I have spoken to You, O  Devi! of the five−jewelled hymn, O Graceful
One! listen now to the  jagan−mangala Mantra of the amulet, by the wearing and reading whereof  one
becomes a knower of the Brahman (66).
MANTRA
May the Supreme Soul protect the head,
May the Supreme Lord protect the heart,
May the Protector of the world protect the throat,
May the All−pervading, All−seeing Lord protect the face (67),
May the Soul of the Universe protect my hands,
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
MANTRA
65

May He Who is Intelligence itself protect the feet,
May the Eternal and Supreme Brahman protect my body in all its parts  always (68).
The Rishi of this world−beneficent amulet is Sada−shiva; the  verse is anushtup, its presiding Devata is the
Supreme Brahman, and the  object of its use is the attainment of Dharmma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha  (69).
He who recites this protective Mantra after offering it to its  Rishi attains knowledge of Brahman, and is one
immediately with the  Brahman (70). If written on birch−bark and encased in a golden ball, it  be worn round
the neck or on the right arm, its wearer attains all  kinds of powers (71). I have now revealed to Thee the
amulet Mantra of  the Supreme Brahman. It should be given to the favourite disciple who  is both devoted to
the Guru and possessed of understanding (72). The  excellent Sadhaka shall, after reciting the Mantra and the
hymn with  reverence, salute the Supreme (73).
Salutation
Ong
I bow to the Supreme Brahman.
I bow to the Supreme Soul.
I bow to Him Who is above all qualities.
I bow to the Ever−existent again and again (74).
The worship of the Supreme Lord may be by body or mind or by word;  but the one thing needful is purity of
disposition (75). After  worshipping in the manner of which I have spoken, the wise man should  with his
friends and kinsmen partake of the holy food consecrated to  the Supreme Spirit. (76) In the worship of the
Supreme there is no need  to invoke Him to be present or to desire Him to depart.
It may be done always and in all places (77). It is of no account  whether the worshipper has or has not bathed,
or whether he be fasting  or have taken food. But the Supreme Spirit should ever be worshipped  with a pure
heart (78). After purification by the Brahma−Mantra,  whatever food or drink is offered to the Supreme Lord
becomes itself  purifying (79). The touch of inferior castes may pollute the water of  Ganga and the
Shaligrama, but nothing which has been consecrated to the  Brahman (80) can be so polluted. If dedicated to
Brahman with this  Mantra, the worshipper with his people may eat of anything, whether  cooked or uncooked
(81). In the partaking of this food no rule as to  caste or time need be observed. No one should hesitate to take
the  leavings from the plate of another, whether such another be pure or  impure. (82).
Whenever and whatsoever the place may be, howsoever it may have been  attained, eat without scruple or
inquiry the food dedicated to the  Brahman (83). Such food, O Devi! even the Devas do not easily get, and  it
purifies even if brought by a Chamdala, or if it be taken from the  mouth of a dog (84). As to that which the
partaking of such food  affects in men, what, O Adored of the Devas! shall We say of it? It is  deemed
excellent even by the Devas. Without a doubt the partaking of  this holy food, be it but once only, frees the
greatest of sinners and  all sinners of their sins (85−86). The mortal who eats of it acquires  such merit as can
only otherwise be earned by bathing and alms at  thirty−five millions of holy places (87). By the eating of it
ten  million times greater merit is gained than by the Horse−sacrifice, or  indeed by any other sacrifice
whatever (88). Its excellence cannot be  described by ten million tongues and a thousand million mouths (89).
Wherever the Sadhaka may be, and though he be a Chandala, he attains to  union with the Brahman the very
moment he partakes of the nectar  dedicated to Him (90). Even Brahmans versed in the Vedanta should take
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Salutation
66

food prepared by low−caste men if it be dedicated to the Brahman (91).  No distinction of caste should be
observed in eating food dedicated to  the Supreme Spirit. He who thinks it impure becomes a great sinner
(92). It would be better, O Beloved! to commit a hundred sins or to  kill a Brahmana than to despise food
dedicated to the Supreme Brahman  (93). Those fools who reject food and drink made holy by the great
Mantra. cause the fall of their ancestors into the lower regions, and  they themselves go headlong into the Hell
of blind darkness, where they  remain until the Dissolution of things. No liberation is there for such  as despise
food dedicated to Brahman (94−95). In the sadhana of this  great Mantra, even acts without merit become
meritorious; in slumber  merit is acquired; and acts are accepted as rightful which are done  according to the
worshipper's desires (96). For such what need is there  of Vedic practices, or for the matter of that what need
is there even  of those of the Tantra? Whatever he does according to his desire, that  is recognized as lawful in
the case of the wise believer in the Brahman  (97). For them there is neither merit nor demerit in the
performance or  non−performance of the customary rites. In the sadhana of this Mantra  his faults or omissions
are no obstacle (98). By the sadhana of this  Mantra, O Great Devi! man becomes truthful, conqueror of the
passions  devoted to the good of his fellow−men, one to whom all things are  indifferent, pure of purpose, free
of envy and arrogance, merciful and  pure of mind, devoted to the service and seeking the of his parents, a
listener ever to things devine, a meditator ever on the Brahman. His  mind is ever turned to the search for
Brahman. With strength of  determination holding his mind in close control, he is ever conscious  of the
nearness of Brahman (99−101). He who is initiated in the  Brahma−Mantra will not lie or think to harm, and
will shun to go with  the wives of others (102). At the commencement of all rites, let him  say, "Tat Sat"; and
before eating or drinking aught let him say, "I  dedicate this to Brahman" (103). For the knower of Brahman,
duty  consists in action for the well−being of fellow−men. This is the  eternal Dharmma.
I will now, O Shambhavi! speak to Thee of the duties relating to  Sandhya in the practice of the Brahma
Mantra, whereby men acquire that  real wealth which comes to them in the form of Brahman (105).
Wheresoever he may be, and in whatsoever posture, the excellent and  well−intentioned sadhaka shall, at
morning, noon and eventide, meditate  upon the Brahman in the manner prescribed. Then, O Devi! let him
make  japa of th Gayatri one hundred and eight times. Offering the japa to  the Devata, let him make obeisance
in the way of which I have spoken  (106−108). I have now told thee of the sandhya to be used by him in the
sadhana of the Brahma−Mantra, and by which the worshipper shall become  pure of heart (106−108). Listen
to Me now, Thou Who art figured with  grace, to the Gayatri, which destroys all sin.
Say "Parameshvara" in the dative singular, then "vidmahe," and, Dear  One, after the word "Paratattvaya" say
"dhimahi," adding, O Devi! the  words, "tanno Brahma prachodayat."
MANTRA
"May we know the Supreme Lord; let us contemplate the Supreme  Essence, and may that Brahman direct us."
This is the auspicious Brahma−Gayatri which confers Dharmma, Artha,  Kama, and Moksha (109−111).
Let everything which is done, be it worship or sacrifice, bathing,  drinking, or eating, be accompanied by the
recitation of the  Brahma−Mantra (112). When arising at the middle of the fourth quarter  of the night, and
after bowing to the Preceptor who gave initiation in  the Brahma−Mantra, let it be recited with all recollection.
Then  obeisance should be made to the Brahman as aforesaid, after meditating  upon Him. This is the enjoined
morning rites (113). For Purashcharana,  O Beautiful One! japa of the Mantra should be done thirty−two
thousand  times, for oblations three thousand two hundred times; for the  presenting of or offering water to the
Devata, three hundred and twenty  times; for purification before worship thirty−two times; and Rrahmanas
should be feasted four times(114−115). In Purashcharana no rule need be  observed touching food or as
regards what should be accepted or  rejected. Nor need an auspicious time nor place for performance be
selected (116). Whether he be fasting or have taken food, whether with  or without bathing, let the Sadhaka, as
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
MANTRA
67

he be so inclined, make sadhana  with this supreme Mantra (117). Without trouble or pain, without hymn,
amulet, nyasa, mudra, or setu, without the worship of Ganesha as the  Thief, yet surely and shortly the most
Supreme Brahman is met face to  face (118−119).
In the sadhana of this great Mantra no other Sangkalpa is necessary  than the inclination of the mind thereto
and purity of disposition. The  worshipper of Brahman sees Brahman in everything (120). The worshipper
does not sin, nor does he suffer harm should he perchance in such  sadhana omit anything. On the contrary, if
there be any omission, the  use of this great Mantra is the remedy therefor (121). In this terrible  and sinful Age
devoid of tapas which is so difficult to traverse, the  very seed of liberation is the use of the Brahma−Mantra
(122). Various  Tantras and Agamas have prescribed various modes of sadhana, but these,  O Great Devi! are
beyond the powers of the feeble men of this Age  (123). For these, O Beloved! are short−lived, without
enterprise, their  life dependent on food, covetous, eager to gain wealth, so unsettled in  their intellect that it is
without rest, even in its attempts at yoga.  Incapable, too, are they of suffering and impatient of the austerities
of yoga. For the happiness and liberation of such have been ordained  the Way of Brahman (124−125). O
Devi! verily and verily I say to You  that in this Age there is no other way to happiness and liberation than
that by initiation in Brahma−Mantra; I again say to You there is no  other way (126). The rule in all the
Tantras is that that which is  prescribed for the morning should be done in the morning, Sandhya  thrice daily
and worship at midday, but, O Auspicious One! in the  worship of Brahman there is no other rule but the
desire of the  worshipper (127). Since in Brahma−worship rules are but servants and  the prohibitions of other
worships do not prevail, who will seek  shelter in any other? (128). Let the disciple obtain a Guru who is a
knower of Brahman, peaceful and of placid mind, and then, clasping his  lotus−like feet, let him supplicate
him as follows:
Supplication to the Guru
O merciful one! Lord of the distressed! to thee I have come for  protection: cast then the shadows of thy
lotus−like feet over my head,  oh thou whose wealth is fame (130).
Having thus with all his powers prayed to and worshipped his Guru,  let the disciple remain before him in
silence with folded hands (131).  The Guru will the carefully examine the signs on and qualities of the
disciple, kindly call the latter to him, and give to the good disciple  the great Mantra (132). Let the wise one
sitting on a seat, with his  face to the East or to the North place his disciple on his left, and  gaze with
tenderness upon him (133). The Guru, after performing  Rishi−nyasa, will then place his hand on his disciple's
head, and for  the siddhi of the latter make japa of the Mantra one hundred and eight  times (134).
Let the excellent Guru, ocean of kindness, next whisper the Mantra  seven times into the right ear of the
disciple if he be a Brahmana, or  into the left ear if he be of another caste (135). O Kalika! I have now
described the manner in which instructions in Brahma−Mantra should be  given. For this there is no need of
puja, and his Sangkalpa should be  mental only (136). The Guru should then raise the disciple, now become
his son, who is lying prostrate at his lotus−feet, and say with  affection the following (137).
Reply of the Guru
Rise, my son, thou art liberated: Be ever devoted to the knowledge  of Brahman: Conquer thy passions: May
thou be truthful, and have  strength and health (138).
Let the excellent disciple on rising make an offering of his own  self, money or a fruit, as he may afford.
Remaining obedient to his  preceptor's commands, he may then roam the world like a Deva (139).
Immediately upon his initiation into this Mantra his soul is suffused  with the Divine Being. What need, then,
O Deveshi! for such an one to  practise various kinds of sadhana? O Dearest One! I have now briefly  told You
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Supplication to the Guru
68

of the initiation into the Brahma−Mantra (140). For such  initiation the merciful mood of the Guru is alone
necessary (141). The  worshipper of the Divine Power, of Shiva, of the Sun, of Vishnu,  Ganesha, Brahmanas
versed in the Vedas and all other castes may be  initiated (142).
It is by the grace of this Mantra, O Devi! that I have become the  Deva of Devas, have conquered Death, and
have become the Guru of the  whole world. By it I have done whatever I will, casting from Me  ignorance and
doubt (143). Brahma was the First to receive the Mantra  from Me, and He taught it to the Brahmarshis, who
taught it to the  Devas. From these the Devarshis learnt it. The Sages learnt it of these  last, and royal Rishis
learnt it of Sages, and all have thus,  through the grace of the Supreme Spirit and this Mantra, become one
with Brahman (144−145).
In the use of this Brahma−Mantra, O Great Devi there are no  restrictions. The Guru may without hesitation
give his disciple his own  Mantra, a father may initiate his sons, a brother his brothers, a  husband his, wife, a
maternal uncle his nephews, a maternal grand  father his grandsons (146−147). Such fault as elsewhere there
is in  other worships, in the giving of one's own Mantra, in initiation by a  father or other near relative does not
exist in the case of this great  and successfu Mantra (148). He who has heard it, however it may be from  the
lips of one initiate in the knowledge of Brahman, is purified, and  attains the state of Brahman, and is affected
neither by virtue nor sin  (149). The householder of the Brahmanas and other castes who pray with  the
Brahma Mantra should be respected and worshipped as being the  greatest of their respective classes (150).
Brahmanas at once become like those who have conquered their  passions, and lower castes become equal to
Brihmanas: therefore let all  worship those initiate in the Brahma−Mantra, and thus possessed of  Divine
knowledge (151). They who slight them are as wicked as the  slayers of Brahmanas, and go to a terrible
Hell,where they remain as  long as the Sun and Stars endure (152). To revile and calumniate a  worshipper of
the Supreme Brahman is a sin ten million times worse than  that of killing a woman or bringing about an
abortion (153). As men by  initiation in the Brahma−Mantra become freed of all sins, so, O Devi!  also may
they be freed by the worship of Thee (154).

Prakriti
HAVING listened with attention to that which has been said  concerning the worship of the Supreme
Brahman, the Supreme Devi greatly  pleased again thus questioned Shankara (1).
Shri Devi said:
O Lord of the Universe and Husband! I bathe with contentment in the  nectar of Thy words concerning the
excellent worship of the Supreme,  which lead to the well−being of the world and to the path of Brahman,  and
gives light, intelligence, strength, and prosperity (2−3). Thou  hast said, 0 Ocean of Mercy! that as union with
the Brahman is  attainable through worship of Him, so, it may be attained by worship of  Me (4). I wish to
know, O Lord! of this excellent worship of Myself,  which as Thou sayest is the cause of union of the
worshipper with the  Brahman (5). What are its rites, and by what means may it be  accomplished? What is its
Mantra, and what the form of its meditation  and mode of worship? (6). O Shambhu! who but Thee, great
Physician of  earthly ills, is fit to speak of it, from its beginning to its end, and  in all its detail agreeable as it is
to Me and beneficent to all  humanity? (7).
Hearing the words of the Devi, the Deva of Devas, Husband of  Parvati, was delighted, and spoke to Her thus:

Shri Sadashiva said:
Listen, O Thou of high fortune and destiny, to the reasons why Thou  shouldst be worshipped, and how
thereby the individual becomes united  with the Brahman (9). Thou art the only Para Prakriti of the Supreme
Soul Brahman, and from Thee has sprung the whole Universe  O Shiva  its  Mother (10). O gracious One !
whatever there is in this world, of  things which have and are without motion, from Mahat to an atom, owes
its origin to and is dependent on Thee (11). Thou art the Original of  all the manifestations; Thou art the
birthplace of even Us; Thou  knowest the whole world, yet none know Thee (12).
Thou art Kali, Tarini, Durga, Shodashi, Bhuvaneshvari, Dhumavati.  Thou art Bagala, Bhairavi, and
Chhinna−mastaka. Thou art Anna−purna,  Vagdevi, Kama−lalaya. Thou art the Image or Embodiment of all
the  Shaktis and of all the Devas (13−14). Thou art both Subtle and Gross,  Manifested and Veiled, Formless,
yet with form. Who can understand  Thee? (15). For the accomplishment of the desire of the worshipper, the
good of the world, and the destruction of the Danavas, Thou dost assume  various forms (16). Thou art
four−armed, two−armed, six−armed, and  eight−armed, and holdest various missiles and weapons for the
protection of the Universe (17). In other Tantras I have spoken of the  different Mantras and Yantras, with the
use of which Thou shouldst be  worshipped according to Thy different forms, and there, too, have I  spoken of
the different dispositions of men (18). In this Kali Age  there is no Pashu−bhava: Divya−bhava is difficult of
attainment, but  the practices relating to Vira−sadhana yield visible fruit (19).
In this Kali Age, O Devi! success is achieved by Kaulika worship  alone, and therefore should it be performed
with every care (20). By  it, O Devi! is acquired the knowledge of Brahman, and the mortal  endowed
therewith is of a surety whilst living freed from future births  and exonerated from the performance of all
religious rites (21).  According to human knowledge the world appears to be both pure and  impure, but when
Brahma−jnana has been acquired there is no distinction  between pure and impure (22). For to him who
knows that the Brahman is  in all things and eternal, what is there that can be impure? (23). Thou  art the
Image of all, and above all Thou art the Mother of all. If Thou  art pleased, O Queen of the Devas! then all are
pleased (24).
Before the Beginning of things Thou didst exist in the form of a  Darkness which is beyond both speech and
mind, and of Thee by the  creative desire of the Supreme Brahman was the entire Universe born  (25). This
Universe, from the great principle of Mahat down to the  gross elements, has been created by Thee, since
Brahman Cause of all  causes is but the instrumental Cause (26). It is the Ever−existent,  Changeless,
Omnipresent, Pure Intelligence unattached to, yet existing  in and enveloping all things (27). It acts not,
neither does It enjoy.  It moves not, neither is It motionless. It is the Truth and Knowledge,  without beginning
or end, Ineffable and Incomprehensible (28).
Thou the Supreme Yogini dost, moved by his mere desire, create,  protect, and destroy this world with all that
moves and is motionless  therein (29). Mahakala, the Destroyer of the Universe, is Thy Image. At  the
Dissolution of things, it is Kala Who will devour all (30), and by  reason of this He is called Mahakala, and
since Thou devourest Mahakala  Himself, it is Thou who art the Supreme Primordial Kalika (31).
Because Thou devourest Kala, Thou art Kali, the original form of all  things, and because Thou art the Origin
of and devourest all things  Thou art called the Adya Kali (32). Resuming after Dissolution Thine  own form,
dark and formless, Thou alone remainest as One ineffable and  inconceivable (33). Though having a form, yet
art Thou formless; though  Thyself without beginning, multiform by the power of Maya, Thou art the
Beginning of all, Creatrix, Protectress, and Destructress that Thou art  (34). Hence it is, 0 Gentle One! that
whatsoever fruit is attained by  initiation in the Brahma−Mantra, the same may be had by the worship of  Thee
(35).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 4  − Introduction of the  Worship of the Supreme Prakriti

According to the differences in place, time, and capacity of the  worshippers I have, O Devi! in some of the
Tantras spoken of secret  worship suited to their respective customs and dispositions (36). Where  men
perform that worship which they are privileged to perform, there  they participate in the fruits of worship, and
being freed from sin  will with safety cross the Ocean of Being (37). By merit acquired in  many previous
births the mind inclines to Kaulika doctrine, and he  whose soul is purified by such worship himself becomes
Shiva (38).  Where there is abundance of enjoyment, of what use is it to speak of  Yoga, and where there is
Yoga there is no enjoyment, but the Kaula  enjoys both (39).
If one honours but one man versed in the knowledge of the essence of  Kula doctrine, then all the Devas and
Devis are worshipped  there is no  doubt of that (40).
The merit gained by honouring a Kaulika is ten million times that  which is acquired by giving away the
world with all its gold (41). A  Chandala versed in the knowledge of Kaulika doctrine excels a Brahmana,  and
a Brahmana who is wanting in such knowledge is beneath even a  Chandala. (42).
I know of no Dharmma superior to that of the Kaulas, by adherence to  which man becomes possessed of
Divine knowledge (43). I am telling Thee  the truth, O Devi! Lay it to the heart and ponder over it. There is no
doctrine superior to the Kaulika doctrine, the most excellent of all  (44). This is the most excellent path kept
hidden by reason of the  crowd of Pashus, but when the Kali Age advances this pathway will be  revealed (45).
Verily and verily I say unto you that when the Kali Age reaches the  fullness of its strength there will be no
Pashus, and all men on earth  will be followers of the Kaulika doctrine (46). O Vararohe! know that  when
Vedic and Puranic initiations cease then the Kali Age has become  strong (47). O Shive! 0 Peaceful One!
when virtue and vice are no  longer judged by the Vedic rules, then know that the Kali Age has  become strong
(48).
O Sovereign Mistress of Kaula doctrine! when the Heavenly Stream is  at some places broken, and at others
diverted from its course, then  know that the Kali Age has become strong (49). O Wise One! when kings  of
the Mlechchha race become excessively covetous, then know that the  Kali Age has become strong (50).
When women become difficult of control, heartless and quarrelsome,  and calumniators of their husbands,
then know that the Kali Age has  become strong (51). When men become subject to women and slaves of  lust,
oppressors of their friends and Gurus, then know that the Kali  Age has become strong (52). When the fertility
of the earth has gone  and yields a poor harvest, when the clouds yield scanty rain, and trees  give meagre fruit,
then know that the Kali Age has become strong (53).  When brothers, kinsmen, and companions, prompted by
the desire for some  trifle, will strike one another, then know that the Kali Age has become  strong (54). When
the open partaking of flesh and liquor will pass  without condemnation and punishment, when secret drinking
will prevail,  then know that the Kali Age has become strong (55).
As in the Satya, Treta, and Dvapara Ages wine and the like could be  taken, so they may be taken in the Kali
Age in accordance with the  Kaulika Dharmma (56). The Kali Age cannot harm those who are purified  by
truth, who have conquered their passions and senses, who are open in  their ways, without deceit, are
compassionate and follow the Kaula  doctrine (57). The Kali Age cannot harm those who are devoted to the
services of their Guru, to the lotus of their mothers' feet, and to  their own wives (58). The Kali Age cannot
harm those who are vowed to  and grounded in truth, adherents of the true Dharmma, and faithful to  the
performance of Kaulika rites and duties (59). The Kali Age cannot  harm those who give to the truthful
KaulikaYogi the elements of  worship, which have been previously purified by Kaulika rites (60).
The Kali Age cannot harm those who are free of malice, envy,  arrogance, and hatred, and who are firm in the
faith of Kaulika dharmma  (61). The Kali Age cannot harm those who keep the company of Kaulikas,  or live
with Kaulika Sages, or serve the Kaulikas (62). The Kali Age  cannot harm those Kaulikas who, whatever
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 4  − Introduction of the  Worship of the Supreme Prakriti
71

they may appear outwardly to  be, yet remain firm in their Kaulika Dharmma, worshipping Thee  according to
its doctrine (63). The Kali Age cannot harm those who  perform their ablutions, charities, penances,
pilgrimages, devotions,  and offerings of water according to the Kaulika ritual (64).
The Kali Age cannot harm those who perform the ten purificatory  ceremonies, such as the blessing of the
womb, obsequial ceremonies of  their fathers, and other rites according to Kaulika ritual (65). The  Kali Age
cannot harm those who respect the Kaula−tattva, Kaula−dravya,  and Kaula−yogi (66).
The Kali Age is but the slave of those who are free of all  crookedness and falsehood, men of candour,
devoted to the good of  others, who follow Kaulika ways (67). In spite of its many blemishes,  the Kali Age
possesses one great merit, that from the mere intention of  a Kaulika of firm resolution desired result ensues
(68). In the other  Ages, O Devi! effort of will produced both religious merit and demerit,  but in the Kali Age
men by intention merely acquire merit only, and not  demerit (68). The slaves of the Kali Age, on the other
hand, are those  who know not Kulachara, and who are ever untruthful and the persecutors  of others (70).
They too are the slaves of the Kali Age who have no  faith in Kulacharas, who lust after others' wives, and
hate them who  are faithful to Kaulika doctrine (71).
In speaking of the customs of the different Ages, I have, O Gentle  One! and out of love, O Parvati! truly
recounted to Thee the signs of  the dominance of the Kali Age (72). When the Kali Age is made manifest,
piety is enfeebled and Truth alone remains; therefore should one be  truthful (73). O Thou Virtuous One!
know this for certain, that  whatsoever man does with Truth that bears fruit (74). There is no  Dharmma higher
than Truth, there is no sin greater than falsehood;  therefore should man seek protection under Truth with all
his soul  (75). Worship without Truth is useless, and so too without Truth is the  Japa of Mantras and the
performance of Tapas. It is in such cases just  as if one sowed seed in salt earth (76).
Truth is the appearance of the Supreme Brahman; Truth is the most  excellent of all Tapas; every act is rooted
in Truth. Than Truth there  is nothing more excellent (77). Therefore has it been said by Me that  when the
sinful Kali Age is dominant, Kaula ways should be practised  truthfully and without concealment (78). Truth
is divorced from  concealment. There is no concealment without untruth. Therefore is it  that the
Kaulika−sadhaka, should perform his Kaulika−sadhana openly  (79). What I have said in other Kaulika
Tantras about the concealment  of Kaulika−dharmma not being blameworthy is not applicable when the  Kali
Age becomes strong (8o).
In the (First or) Satya. Age, O Devi! Virtue possessed the four  quarters of its whole; in the Treta Age it lost
one−quarter of its  Virtue; in the Dvapara Age there was of Virtue but two quarters, and in  the Kali Age it has
but one (81). In spite of that Truth will remain  strong, though Tapas and Charity become weakened. If Truth
goes Virtue  goes also, therefore of all acts Truth should be the abiding support  (82). O Sovereign Mistress of
the Kaula−Dharmma! since men can in this  Age have recourse to Kaulika Dharmma only, if that doctrine be
itself  infected with untruth, how can there be liberation? (83). With his soul  purified in every way by Truth,
man should, according to his caste and  stage of life, perform the following acts in the manner shown by Me
(84): initiation, worship, recitation of Mantras, the worship of Fire  with ghee, repetition of Mantras, private
devotions, marriage, the  conception ceremony, and that performed in the fourth, sixth, or eighth  months of
pregnancy, the natal rite, the naming and tonsure ceremonies,  and obsequial rites upon cremation and after
death. All such ceremonies  should be performed in the manner approved by the Agamas (85−86).
The ritual which I have ordained should be followed, too, as regards  Shraddha at holy places, dedication of a
bull, the autumnal festival,  on setting out on a journey, on the first entry into a house, the  wearing of new
clothes or jewels, dedication of tanks, wells, or lakes,  in the ceremonies performed at the phases of the Moon,
the building and  consecration of houses, the installation of Devas, and in all  observances to be performed
during the day or at night, in each month,  season, or year, and in observances both daily or occasional, and
also  in deciding generally what ought and what ought not to be done, and in  determining what ought to be
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 4  − Introduction of the  Worship of the Supreme Prakriti
72

rejected and what ought to be adopted  (87−90). Should one not follow the ritual ordained, whether from
ignorance, wickedness, or irreverence, then one is disqualified for all  observances, and becomes a worm in
dung (91). O Maheshi! if when the  Kali Age has become very powerful any act be done in violation of My
precepts, then that which happens is the very contrary of that which is  desired (92). Initiation of which I have
not approved destroys the life  of the disciple, and his act of worship is as fruitless as oblations  poured on
ashes, and the Deva whom he worships becomes angry or  hostile, and at every step he encounters danger
(93). Ambika! he who  during the dominance of the Kali Age, knowing My ordinances, yet  performs his
religious observances in other ways, is a great sinner  (94). The man who performs any Vrata, or marries
according to other  ways, will remain in a terrible Hell so long as the Sun and Moon endure  (95). By his
performance of Vrata he incurs the sin of killing a  Brahmana, and similarly by being invested with the sacred
thread he is  degraded. He merely wears the thread, and is lower than a Chandala  (96), and so too the woman
who is married according to other ways than  Mine is to be despised, and, 0 Sovereign Mistress of the Kaulas!
the  man who so marries is her associate in wrong, and is day after day  guilty of the sin of going with a
prostitute (97). From him the Devata  will not accept food, water, and other offerings, nor will the Pitris  eat
his offerings, considering them to be as it were mere dung and pus  (98). Their children are bastards, and
disqualified for all religious,  ancestral, and Kaulika observances and rites (99). To an image  dedicated by
rites other than those prescribed by Shambhu the Deva  never comes. Benefit there is none either in this or the
next world.  There is but mere waste of labour and money (100).
A Shraddha performed according to other rites than those prescribed  by the Agamas is fruitless, and he who
performs it will go to Hell  together with his Pitris (101). The water offered by him is like blood,  and the
funeral cake like dung. Let the mortal then follow with great  care the precepts of Shankara (102). What is the
need of saying more?  Verily and verily I say to You, O Devi! that all that is done in  disregard of the precepts
of Shambhu is fruitless (103). For him who  follows not His precepts there is no future merit. That which has
been  already acquired is destroyed, and for him there is no escape from Hell  (104). O Great Ruler! the
performance of daily and occasional duties in  the manner spoken of by Me is the same as worshipping Thee
(105).  Listen, O Devi! to the particulars of the worship with its Mantras and  Yantras, which is the medicine
for the ills of the Kali Age (106).
End of the Fourth Chapter, entitled "Introduction of the Worship of  the Supreme Prakriti."
Chapter 5  − The Formation of the  Mantras, Placing of the
Jar, and Purification of the Elements of Worship
SHRI SADASHIVA said:
Thou art the Adya Parama Shakti, Thou art all Power. It is by Thy  power that We (the Trinity) are powerful
in the acts of creation,  preservation, and destruction. Endless and of varied colour and form  are Thy
appearances, and various are the strenuous efforts whereby the  worshippers may realize them. Who can
describe them? (1−2). In the Kula  Tantras and Agamas I have, by the aid of but a small part of Thy  mercies
and with all My powers, described the Sadhana and Archana of  Thy appearances; yet nowhere else is this
very secret Sadhana revealed.  It is by the grace of this (Sadhana), O Blessed One! that Thy mercy in  Me is so
great (3−4). Questioned by Thee I am no longer able to conceal  it. For Thy pleasure, O Beloved! I shall speak
of that which is dearer  to Me than even life itself (5). To all sufferings it brings relief. It  wards off all dangers.
It gives Thee pleasure, and is the way by which  Thou art most swiftly obtained (6). For men rendered
wretched by the  taint of the Kali Age, short−lived and unfit for strenuous effort, this  is the greatest wealth (7).
In this (sadhana) there is no need for a  multiplicity of Nyasa, for fasting or other practices of  self−restraint. It
is simple and pleasurable, yet yields great fruit to  the worshipper (8). Then first listen, O Devi! to the
Mantroddhara of  the Mantra, the mere hearing of which liberates man from future births  while yet living (9).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 5  − The Formation of the  Mantras, Placing of the Jar, and Purification of the Elements of Worship
73

By placing "Pranesha" on "Taijasa," and adding to it "Bherunda" and  the Vindu, the first Vija is formed.
After this, proceed to the second  (to). By placing "Sandhya" on "Rakta," and adding to it "Vama−netra"  and
Vindu, the second Mantra is formed. Now listen, O Blessed One! to  the formation of the third Mantra.
Prajapati is placed on Dipa, and to them is added Govinda and Vindu.  It yields happiness to the worshippers:
After making these three  Mantras add the word Parameshvari in the vocative, and then the word  for
Vahni−kanta. Thus, O Blessed One! is the Mantra of ten letters  formed. This Vidya of the Supreme Devi
contains in itself all Mantras  (11−13).
The most excellent worshipper should for the attainment of wealth  and all his desires make Japa of each or all
of the first three Vijas  (14). By omitting the first three Devi the Vidya of ten letters become  one of seven. By
prefixing the Vija of Kama, or the Vagbhava, or the  Tara, three Mantras of eight letters each are formed (15).
At the end of the Mantra of ten letters the word Kalika in the  vocative should be uttered, and then the first
three Vija, followed by  the name of the Wife of Vahni (16). This Vidya is called Shodashi, and  is concealed
in all the Tantras. If it be prefixed by the Vija of Vadhu  or by the Pranava, two Mantras of seventeen letters
each are formed  (17).
O Beloved! there are tens of millions upon tens of millions, nay an  hundred millions, nay countless Mantras
for Thy worship. I have here  but shortly stated twelve of them (18). Whatsoever Mantras are set  forth in the
various Tantras, they are all Thine, since Thou art the  Adya Prakriti (19). There is but one sadhana in the case
of all these  Mantras, and of that I shall speak for Thy pleasure and the benefit of  humanity (20).
Without Kulachara, O Devi! the Shakti−Mantra is powerless to give  success, and therefore the worshipper
should worship the Shakti with  Kulachara rites
O Adya! the five essential Elements in the worship of Shakti have  been prescribed to be Wine, Meat, Fish,
parched Grain, and the Union of  man with woman (22). The worship of Shakti without these five elements  is
but the practice of evil magic. That Siddhi which is the object of  sadhana is never attained thereby, and
obstacles are encountered at  every step (23). As seed sown on barren rocks does not germinate, so  worship
without these five elements is fruitless (24).
Without the prior performance of the morning rites a man is not  qualified to perform the others. And
therefore, O Devi! I shall first  speak of those which are to be performed in the morning (25). In the  second
half of the last quarter of the night the disciple should rise  from sleep. Having seated himself and shaken off
drowsiness, let him  meditate upon the image of his Guru:
Dhyana
As two−eyed and two−armed, situate in the white lotus of the head  (26); clad in white raiment, engarlanded
with white flowers, smeared  with sandal paste. With one hand he makes the sign which dispels fear,  and with
the other that which bestows blessings. He is calm, and is the  image of mercy. On his left his Shakti, holding
in her hand a lotus,  embraces him. He is smiling and gracious, the bestower of the  fulfilment of the desires of
his disciples (27−28).
O Kuleshvari! the disciple should, after having thus meditated upon  his Teacher and worshipped him with the
articles of mental worship,  make Japa with the excellent Mantra, the Vagbhava−Vija. (29).
After doing Japa of the Mantra as best lies in his power, the wise  disciple should, after placing the Japa in the
right palm of his  excellent Guru, bow before him, saying meanwhile the following (30):
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Dhyana
74

Mantra
I bow to thee, O Sad−guru,
Thou who destroyeth the bonds which hold us to this world,
Thou who bestoweth the vision of Wisdom,
Together with worldly enjoyment and final liberation,
Dispeller of ignorance,
Revealer of the Kula−dharmma,
Image in human form of the Supreme Brahman (31−32).
The disciple, having thus made obeisance to his Guru, should  meditate upon his Ishta−devata, and worship
Her as aforesaid, inwardly  reciting the Mula−mantra meanwhile (33). Having done this to the best  of his
powers, he should place the Japa in the left palm of the Devi,  and then make obeisance to his Ishta−devata
with the following (34):
Mantra
To thee I bow Who art one with, and the Supporter of, the Universe,
I bow to Thee again and yet again, the Adya Kalika, both Creatrix  and Destructress (35).
Having thus made obeisance to the Devi, he should leave his house,  placing his left foot first, and then make
water, discharge his bowels,  and cleanse his teeth (36). He then should go towards some water, and  make his
ablutions in the manner prescribed (37). First of all let him  rinse his mouth, and then enter the water, and
stand therein up to his  navel. He should then cleanse his body by a single immersal only, and  then, standing
up and rubbing himself, rinse his mouth, saying the  Mantra the while (38). That best of worshippers, the
Kula−Sadhaka,  should then sip a little water and say:
Mantra
Atma−tattvaya Svaha
After that he should again sip water twice, followed in each case by  the
Mantras
Vidya−tattvaya Svaha.
Shiva−tattvaya Svaha,
respectively. Lastly, he should rinse the upper lip twice (39).
Then, O Beloved! the wise disciple should draw on the water the  Kula−yantra with the Mantra in its centre,
and do Japa over it with the  Mula−mantra twelve times (40). Then meditating on the Water as the  Image of
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
75

Fire, let him offer it thrice to the Sun in his joined palms.  Sprinkling it thrice over his head, let him close the
seven openings  therein (41). Then for the pleasure of the Devi he should immerse  himself thrice, leave the
water, dry his body, and put on two pieces of  clean cloth.
Tying up his hair whilst reciting the Gayatri, he should mark on his  forehead with pure earth or ashes the
tilaka and tri−pundra, with a  Vindu over it (42). Let the worshipper then perform both the Vaidika  and
Tantrika forms of Sandhya in their respective order. Listen while I  now describe to you the Tantrika Sandhya
(4g).
After rinsing his mouth in the manner described, he should, O  Blessed One! invoke into the water the Waters
of the holy Rivers thus  (45):
Mantra
O Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmmada,
Sindhu, Kaveri, come into this water (46).
The intelligent worshipper having invoked the sacred Rivers with  this Mantra, and made the
angkusha−mudra, should do Japa with the  Mula−mantra twelve times (47). Let him then again utter the
Mula−mantra, and with the middle and nameless fingers joined together  throw drops of that water thrice upon
the ground (48).
He should then sprinkle his head seven times with the water, and  taking some in the palm of his left hand
cover it up with his right  (49). Then inwardly reciting the Vija of Ishana, Vayu, Varuna, Vahni,  and Indra
four times, the water should be transferred to the right palm  (50). Seeing (in his mind's eye) and meditating
upon the water as Fire,  the worshipper should draw it through the nose by Ida, expel it through  Pingala (into
his palm), and so wash away all inward impurity (51).
The worshipper should then three times dash the water (so expelled  into his palm) against an (imaginary)
adamant. Uttering the  Astra−Mantra, let him then wash his hands (52). Then rinsing his mouth,  oblation of
water should be offered to the Sun with the following (53):
Mantra
Ong Hring Hangsa
To Thee, O Sun, full of heat, shining, effulgent, I offer this  oblation; Svaha (54).
Then let him meditate morning, midday, and evening upon the great  Devi Gayatri, the Supreme Devi, as
manifested in her three different  forms and according to the three qualities (55).
Dhyana
In the morning meditate upon Her in Her Brahmi form, as a Maiden of  ruddy hue, with a pure smile, with two
hands, holding a gourd full of  holy water, garlanded with crystal beads, clad in the skin of a black  antelope,
seated on a Swan (56). At midday meditate upon Her in Her  Vaishnavi form, of the colour of pure gold,
youthful, with full and  rising breasts, situated in the Solar disc, with four hands holding the  conch−shell,
discus, mace, and lotus, seated on Garuda, garlanded with  wild−flowers (57−58). In the evening the Yati
should meditate upon Her  as of a white colour, clad in white raiment, old and long past her  youth, with three
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
76

eyes, beneficent, propitious, seated on a Bull,  holding in Her lotus−like hands a noose, a trident, a lance, and
a  skull (59−60).
Having thus meditated on the great Devi Gayatri, and offered water  three times in the hollow of his joined
hands, the worshipper should  make Japa with the Gayatri either ten or a hundred times (61). Listen  now, O
Devi of the Devas! while I out of my love for Thee recite the  Gayatri (62).
After the word "Adyayai" say "vidmahe," and then "Parameshvaryyai  dhimahi: tannah Kali prachodayat."
This is Thy Gayatri which destroys  all great sins (63). The inward recitation of this Vidya thrice daily  obtains
the fruit of the performance of Sandhya. Water should then be  offered to the Devas, Rishis, and the Pitris
(64). First say the  Pranava, and then the name of the Deva (the Rishi or the Pitri)  in the accusative case, and
after that the words "tarpayami namah."  When, however, oblation is offered to Shakti, the Maya Vija should
be  said in place of the Pranava, and in lieu of Namah the Mantra Svaha  (65).
After uttering the Mula−mantra, say "Sarvva−bhuta−nivasinyai," and  then "Sarvva−svarupa" and "Sayudha"
in the dative singular, as also  "Savarana" and "Paratpara," and then "Adyayai, Kalikayai, te, idam  arghyam:
Svaha" (66−67). (When the Mantra will be.)
Mantra
Hring, Shring, Kring, to the Supreme Devi. O Supreme Devi, Thou Who  dwelleth in all things and Whose
image all things are, Who art  surrounded by attendant deities, and Who bearest arms, Who art above  even the
most high to Thee, Who art the Adya Kalika, I offer this  oblation: Svaha.
Having offered this arghya to the Mahadevi, the wise one should make  Japa with the Mula−mantra with all
his powers, and then place the Japa  in the left hand of the Devi (68). Then let the Sadhaka bow to the  Devi,
take such water as is needed for his worship, bowing to the water  whence he has drawn it, and proceed to the
place of worship, earnestly  meditating on and reciting hymns of praise to the Devi meanwhile. On  his arrival
there let him wash his hands and feet, and then make in  front of the door the Samanyarghya (69−70). The
wise one should draw a  triangle, and outside it a circle, and outside the circle a square, and  after worshipping
the Adhara−shakti place the vessel on the figure (71).
Let him wash the vessel with the Weapon−Mantra, and while filling it  with water let him say the
Heart−Mantra. Then, throwing flowers and  perfume into the water, let him invoke the holy Rivers into it
(72).  Worshipping Fire, Sun, and Moon in the water of the vessel, let him say  the Maya Vija over it (73). The
Dhenu and Yoni Mudras should then be  shown. This is known as Samanyarghya. With the water and flowers
of  this oblation the Devata of the entrance to the place of worship should  be worshipped (74), such as
Ganesha, Kshetrapala, Vatuka, Yogini,  Ganga, Yamuna, Lakshmi, and Vani (75). The wise one, lightly
touching  that part of the door−frame which is on his left, should then enter the  place of worship with his left
foot forward, meditating the while on  the lotus−feet of the Devi (76). Then, after worship of the presiding
Deva of the site, and of Brahma in the south−west corner, the place of  worship should be cleansed with water
taken from the common offering  (77). Let the best of worshippers then with a steady gaze remove all  celestial
obstacles, and by the repetition of the Weapon−Mantra remove  all obstacles in the Anta−riksha (78).
Striking the ground three times with his heel, let him drive away  all earthly obstacles, and then fill the place
of worship with the  incense of burning sandal, fragrant aloe, musk, and camphor. He should  then mark off a
rectangular space as his seat, draw a triangle within  it, and therein worship Kama−rupa with the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra

Mantra 
To Kama−rupa, Namah: (79−80).
Then for his seat spreading a mat over it, let him worship the  Adhara−Shakti with the
Mantra
Kling, Obeisance to the Adhara−Shakti of the  lotus−seat (81).
The learned worshipper should then seat himself according to the  "tied heroic" mode, with his face towards
the East or the North, and  should consecrate the Vijaya (81). (With the following)
Mantra
Ong Hring. Ambrosia, that springeth from ambrosia, Thou that  showereth ambrosia, draw ambrosia for me
again and again. Bring Kalika  within my control. Give siddhi; Svaha.
This is the Mantra for the consecration of Vijaya (83−84). Then  inwardly reciting the Mula−mantra seven
times over the Vijaya, show the  Dhenu, the Yoni, the Avahani, and other Mudras (85).
Then satisfy the Guru who resides in the Lotus of a thousand petals  by thrice offering the Vijaya with the
Sangketa−Mudra, and the Devi in  the heart by thrice offering the Vijaya with the same Mudra, and  reciting
the Mula−mantra (86). Then offer oblations to the mouth of the  Kundali, with the Vijaya reciting the
following
Mantra
Aing (0 Devi Sarasvati), Thou Who art the Ruler of all the essences,  do Thou inspire me, do Thou inspire me,
and remain ever on the tip of  my tongue; Svaha (87).
After drinking the Vijaya he should bow to the Guru, placing his  folded palms over the left ear, then to
Ganesha, placing his folded  palms over his right ear, and lastly to the Eternal Adya Devi, by  placing his
folded palms in the middle of his forehead, and should the  meanwhile meditate on the Devi. (88).
The wise worshipper should place the articles necessary for worship  on his right, and scented water and other
Kula articles on his left  (89). Saying the Mula−mantra terminated by the Weapon−Mantra, let him  take water
from the common offering and sprinkle the articles of  worship with it, and then enclose himself and the
articles in a circle  of water. After that, O Devi! let him by the Vahni Vija surround them  with a wall of fire
(90). Then for the purification of the palms of his  hands he should take up a flower which has been dipped in
sandal paste,  rub it between the palms, reciting meanwhile the Mantra Phat, and throw  it away (91).
Then in the following manner let him fence all the quarters so that  no obstructions proceed from them. Join
the first and second fingers of  the right hand, and tap the palm of the left hand three times, each  time after the
first with greater force, thus making a loud sound, and  then snap the fingers while uttering the
weapon−Mantra (92). He should  then proceed to perform the purification of the elements of his body.  The
excellent disciple should place his hands in his lap with the palms  upwards, and fixing his mind on the
Muladhara Chakra let him rouse  Kundalini by uttering the Vija "Hung." Having so roused Her, let him  lead
Her with Prithivi by means of the Hangsa Mantra to the  Svadhishthana Chakra, and let him there dissolve
each one of the  elements of the body by means of another of such elements (93−94). Then  let him dissolve
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
78

Prithivi together with odour, as also the organ of  smell, into water. Dissolve water and taste, as also the sense
of taste  itself, into Fire (95). Dissolve Fire and vision and form, and the  sense of sight itself, into air (96).
Let air and touch, as also the sense of touch itself, be dissolved  into ether. Dissolve ether and sound into the
conscious Self and the  Self into Mahat, Mahat itself into Prakriti, and Prakriti Herself into  Brahman (97). Let
the wise one, having thus dissolved (the twenty−four)  tattvas, then think of an angry black man in the left
side of the  cavity of his abdomen of the size of his thumb with red beard and eyes,  holding a sword and
shield, with his head ever held low, the very image  of all sins (98−99).
Then the foremost of disciples should, thinking of the purple Vayu  Vija as on his left nostril, inhale through
that nostril sixteen times.  By this let him dry the sinful body (100). Next, meditating on the red  Vija of Agni
as being situate in the navel, the body with all its  sinful inclinations should be burnt up by the fire born of the
Vija, as  also by sixty−four Kumbhakas (101). Then, thinking of the white Varuna  Vija in his forehead, let
him bathe (the body which has been so burnt)  with the nectar−like water dropping from the Varuna Vija by
thirty−two  exhalations (102).
Having thus bathed the whole body from feet to head, let him  consider that a Deva body has come into being
(103). Then, thinking of  the yellow Vija of the Earth as situate in the Muladhara circle, let  him strengthen his
body by that Vija and by a steadfast and winkless  gaze (104). Placing his hand on his heart and uttering the
Mantra
Ang, Hring, Krong, Hangsah, So'hang.
let him infuse into his body the life of the Devi (105).
O Ambika! having thus purified the elements (the disciple) with a  mind well under control, and intent upon
the nature of the Devi, should  do Matrika−nyasa. The Rishi of Matrika is Brahma, and the verse  is Gayatri,
and Matrika is presiding Devi thereof; the consonants are  its Seed, and the vowels its Shaktis, and Visarga is
the End. In  Lipi−nyasa, O Mahadevi! each letter should be separately pronounced as  it is placed in the
different parts of the body. Having similarly  performed Rishi−nyasa, Kara−nyasa and Ang−ga−nyasa should
be  performed (106−108).
O Beauteous Face! the Mantras enjoined for Shad−ang−ga−nyasa are  Ka−varga between Ang and  ng,
Cha−varga between Ing and • ng, Ta−varga  between Ung and ¤ ng, Ta−varga between Eng and Aing, and
Pa−varga  between Ong and Aung, and the letters from Ya to Ksha between Vindu and  Visarga respectively
(109−110), and having placed the letters according  to the rules of Nyasa, the Sadhaka should then meditate
upon Sarasvati:
Dhyana
I seek refuge in the Devi of Speech, three−eyed, encircled with a  white halo, whose face, hands, feet, middle
body, and breast are  composed of the fifty letters of the alphabet, on whose radiant  forehead is the crescent
moon, whose breasts are high and rounded, and  who with one of her lotus hands makes Jnana−mudra, and
with the other  holds the rosary of Rudraksha beads, the jar of nectar, and learning  (112).
Having thus meditated upon the Devi Matrika, place the letters in  the six Chakras as follows: Ha and Kska in
the Ajna Lotus, the sixteen  vowels in the Vishuddha Lotus, the letters from Ka to Tha in the  Anahata Lotus,
the letters from Da to Pha in Manipura Lotus, the  letters from Ba to La in the Svadhishthana Lotus, and in the
Muladhara  Lotus the letters Va to Sa. And having thus in his mind placed these  letters of the alphabet, let the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra

worshipper place them outwardly  (113−115). Having placed them on the forehead, the face, eyes, ears,  nose,
cheeks, upper lip, teeth, head, hollow of the mouth, back, the  hump of the back, navel, belly, heart, shoulders,
(four) joints in the  arms, end of the arms, heart, (four) joints of the legs, ends of legs,  and on all parts from the
heart to the two arms, from the heart to the  two legs, from the heart to the mouth, and from the heart to the
different parts as above indicated, Pranayama should be performed  (116−118). Draw in the air by the left
nostril whilst muttering the  Maya Vija sixteen times, then fill up the body by Kumbhaka by stopping  the
passage of both the nostrils with the little, third finger, and  thumb whilst making japa of the Vija sixty−four
times, and, lastly,  exhale the air through the right nostril whilst making japa of the Vija  thirty−two times
(119−120). The doing of this thrice through the right  and left nostrils alternately is Pranayama.
After this has been done, Rishi−nyasa should be performed (121). The  Revealers of the Mantra are Brahma
and the Brahmarshis, the metre is of  the Gayatri and other forms, and its presiding Devata is the Adya Kali
(122). The Vija is the Vija of the Adya, its Shakti is the Maya Vija,  and that which comes at the end is the
Kamala Vija (123). Then the  Mantra should be assigned to the head, mouth, heart, anus, the two  feet, and all
the parts of the body (123). The passing of the two hands  three or seven times over the whole body from the
feet to the head, and  from the head to the feet, making japa meanwhile of the Mula−mantra, is  called
Vyapaka−nyasa, which yields the declared result (124).
O Beloved! by adding in succession the six long vowels to the first  Vija of the Mula−mantra, six Vidya are
formed. The wise worshipper  should in Angga−kalpana utter in succession these or the Mula−mantra  alone
(125), and then say "to the two thumbs," "to the two index  fingers," "to the two middle fingers," "to the two
ring fingers," "to  the two little fingers," "to the front and back of the two palms,"  concluding with Namah,
Svaha, Vashat, Hung, Vaushat, and Phat in their  order respectively (126).
When touching the heart say "Namah," when touching the head "Svaha,"  and when touching the crown lock
thereon "Vashat." Similarly, when  touching the two upper portions of the arms, the three eyes and the two
palms, utter the Mantras Hung and Vaushat and Phat respectively. In  this manner nyasa of the six parts of the
body should be practised, and  then the Vira should proceed to Pithanyasa (127−128). Then let the Vira  place
in the lotus of the heart, the Adhara−shakti, the tortoise,  Shesha serpent, Prithivi, the ocean of ambrosia, the
Gem Island, the  Parijata tree, the chamber of gems which fulfil all desires, the  jewelled altar, and the lotus
seat (129−130). Then he should place on  the right shoulder, the left shoulder, the right hip, the left hip,
respectively and in their order, Dharmma, Jnana, Aishvaryya, and  Vairagya (131), and the excellent
worshipper should place the negatives  of these qualities on the mouth, the left side, the navel, and the  right
side respectively (132). Next let him place in the heart Ananda  Kanda, Sun, Moon, Fire, the three qualities,
adding to the first of  their letters the sign Vindu, and the filaments and pericarp of the  Lotus, and let him
place in the petals of the lotus the eight Pitha  Nayikas  Mangala, Vijaya, Bhadra, Jayanti, Aparajita, Nandini,
Narasinghi, Vaishnavi, and in the tips of the petals of the lotus the  eight Bhairavas  Asitanga, Chanda, Kapali,
Krodha, Bhishana, Unmatta,  Ruru, Sanghari (133−135).
Then the worshipper should, after forming his hands into the  Kachchhapa Mudra, take two fragrant flowers,
and, placing his hands on  his heart, let him meditate upon the ever−existent Devi (136). The  nature of
meditation upon Thee, O Devi! is of two kinds, according as  Thou art imagined formless or with a form. As
formless Thou art  ineffable and incomprehensible, imperceptible. Of Thee it cannot be  said that Thou art
either this or that, Thou art omnipresent,  unobtainable, attainable only by Yogis through penances and acts of
self−restraint (137−138). I will now speak of meditation upon Thee in  corporeal form in order that the mind
may learn concentration, that  desires be speedily achieved, and that the power to meditate according  to the
subtle form may be aroused (139).
The form of the greatly lustrous Kalika, Mother of Kala Who devours  all things, is imagined according to Her
qualities and actions (140).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra

Dhyana
I adore the Adya Kalika Whose body is of the hue of the (dark)  rain−cloud, upon Whose forehead the Moon
gleams, the three−eyed One,  clad in crimson raiment, Whose two hands are raised  the one to dispel  fear, and
the other to bestow blessing  Who is seated on a red lotus in  full bloom, Her beautiful face radiant, watching
Maha−Kala, Who, drunk  with the delicious wine of the Madhuka flower, is dancing before Her  (141).
After having meditated upon the Devi in this form, and placed a  flower on his head, let the devotee with all
devotion worship Her with  the articles of mental worship (142). Let him offer the lotus of the  heart for Her
seat, the ambrosia trickling from the lotus of a thousand  petals for the washing of Her feet, and his mind as
arghya (143). Then  let him offer the same ambrosia as water for rinsing of Her mouth and  bathing of Her
body, let him offer the essence of the ether to be  raiment of the Devi, the essence of scent to be the perfumes,
his own  heart and vital air the essence of fire, and the ocean of nectar to be  respectively the flowers, incense,
light, and food offerings (of  worship).
Let him offer the sound in the Anahata Chakra for the ringing of the  bell, the essence of the air for the fan and
fly−whisk, and the  functions of the senses and the restlessness of the mind for the dance  before the Devi
(144−146). Let various kinds of flowers be offered for  the attainment of the object of one's desire: amaya,
anahangkara,  araga, amada, amoha, adambha, advesha, akshobha, amatsaryya, alobha,  and thereafter the five
flowers  namely, the most excellent flowers,  ahingsa, indriya−nigraha, daya, kshama, and jnana. With these
fifteen  flowers, fifteen qualities of disposition, he should worship the Devi  (147−149).
Then let him offer (to the Devi) the ocean of ambrosia, a mountain  of meat and fried fish, a heap of parched
food, grain cooked in milk  with sugar and ghee, the Kula nectar, the Kula flower, and the water  which has
been used for the washing of the Shakti. Then, having  sacrificed all lust and anger, the cause of all
impediments, let him do  japa (150−151).
The mala (rosary) prescribed consists of the letters of the  alphabet, strung on Kundalini as the thread (152).
After reciting the  letters of the alphabet from A to La, with the Vindu superposed upon  each, the
Mula−mantra should be recited. This is known as Anuloma.  Again, beginning with La and ending with A, let
the sadhaka make japa  of the Mantra. This is known as Viloma and Ksha−kara is called the Meru  (153−154).
The last letters of the eight groups should be added to the  Mula−mantra, and having made japa of this Mantra
of one hundred and  eight letters the japa should be offered (to the Devi) with the  following (155):
Mantra
O Adya Kali, Who abidest in the innermost soul of all, Who art the  innermost light, O Mother! accept this
japa of my heart. I bow to Thee  (156).
Having finished the japa, he should mentally prostrate himself,  touching the ground with the eight parts of his
body. Having concluded  the mental worship, let him commence the outer worship (157).
I am now speaking of the consecration of the Vishesh−arghya, by the  mere placing whereof the Devata is
exceedingly pleased. Do Thou listen  (158). At the mere sight of the cup of this offering the Yoginis,
Bhairavas, Brahma, and other Devatas dance for joy and grant siddhi  (159). The disciple should on the
ground in front of him and on his  left draw with water taken from the Samanyarghya a triangle, with the
Maya Vija in its centre, outside the triangle a circle, and outside the  circle a square, and let him there worship
the Shakti of the Adhara  with the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Dhyana
81

Mantra
Hring!
Obeisance to the Shakti of the Adhara (160−161).
He should then wash the Adhara, and place it on the Mandala, and  worship the region of Fire with the
Mantra
Mang!
Obeisance to the circle of Fire possessed of ten  sections.
And having washed the arghya vessel with the Mantra Phat, the  worshipper should place it on the Adhara
with the Mantra Namah  (162−163). He should then worship the cup with the
Mantra
Ang!
Obeisance to the circle of Sun who has twelve  divisions;
and fill the vessel (in which the offering is made) whilst repeating  the Mula−mantra three parts with wine and
one part with water, and  having placed scent and flower in it, he should there worship, O  Mother! with the
Mantra following (164−165):
Mantra
Ung!
Obeisance to the Moon with its sixteen digits (166).
He should then place in front of the special offering, on bael  leaves dipped in red sandal paste, durva grass,
flowers, and sun−dried  rice (167).
Having invoked the holy waters (of the sacred Rivers into the  arghya) by the Mula−mantra and
Angkusha−mudra, the Sadhaka should  meditate upon the Devi, and worship Her with incense and flowers,
making japa of the Mula−mantra twelve times (168). After this let him  display over the arghya the Dhenu
Mudra and the Yoni Mudra, incense  sticks and a light. The worshipper should then pour a little water from
the arghya into the vessel kept for that purpose, and sprinkle himself  and the offering therewith. The vessel
containing the offering must  not, however, be moved until the worship is concluded (169−170). O Thou  of
pure Smiles! I have now spoken of the consecration of the special  offering. I will now pass to the principal
Yantra which grants the aims  of all human existence (171).
Draw a triangle with the Maya Vija within it, and around it two  concentric circles (the one outside the other).
In the space between  the two circumferences of the circles draw in pairs the sixteen  filaments, and outside
these the eight petals of the lotus, and outside  them the Bhu−pura, which should be made of straight lines
with four  entrances, and be of pleasing appearance (172−173). In order to cause  pleasure to the Devata the
disciple should (reciting the Mula−mantra  the meanwhile) draw the Yantra either with a gold needle, or with
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
82

the  thorn of a bael tree on a piece of gold, silver, or copper, which has  been smeared with either the
Svayambhu, Kunda, or Gola flowers, or with  sandal, fragrant aloe, kungkuma, or with red sandal paste. A
clever  carver may also carve the Yantra on crystal, coral, or lapis lazuli  (174−176).
After it has been consecrated by auspicious rites, it should be kept  inside the house; and on this being done all
wicked ghosts, all  apprehensions from (adverse) planets, and diseases are destroyed; and  by the grace of this
Yantra the worshipper's house becomes of pleasing  aspect. With his children and grandchildren, and with
happiness and  dominion, he becomes a bestower of gifts and charities, a protector of  his dependents, and his
fame goes abroad (177−178). After having drawn  the Yantra and placed it on a jewelled altar in front of the
worshipper, and having worshipped the Devata of the Pitha according to  the rules of Pitha−nyasa, the
principal Devi should be adored in the  pericarp of the Lotus (179).
I will now speak of the placing of the jar and the formation of the  circle of worship by the mere institution of
which the Devata is well  pleased, the Mantra becomes fruitful, and the wishes of the worshipper  are
accomplished (180). The jar is called kalasa, because Vishva−karma  made it from the different parts of each
of the Devatas (181).
It should be thirty−six fingers breadth (in circumference) in its  widest part, and sixteen in height. The neck
should be four fingers  breadth, the mouth six fingers, and the bottom five fingers breadth.  This is the rule for
the design of the kalasha (182). It should be made  either of gold, silver, copper, bell−metal, mud, stone, or
glass, and  without hole or crack. In its making all miserliness should be avoided,  since it is fashioned for the
pleasure of the Devas (183). A kalasha of  gold, one of silver, one of copper, and one of bell−metal give
enjoyment, emancipation, pleasure of mind, and nourishment respectively  to the worshipper. One of crystal is
good for the attainment of  Vashikarana, and one of stone for the attainment of Stambhana. A  kalasha made of
mud is good for all purposes. Whatever it is made of it  should be clean and of pleasing design (184).
On his left side the worshipper should draw a hexagon with a point  in its centre, around it a circle, and
outside the circle a square  (185). These figures should be drawn either with vermilion or Rajas
(Kula−pushpa), or red sandal paste; the Devata of the support should  then be worshipped thereon (186). The
Mantra for the worship of the  Shakti or Devi of the support is 
Mantra
Hring,
salutation to the Shakti of the support (187).
The support for the jar should be washed with the Mantra namah, and  placed on the Mandala, and the jar
itself with the Mantra Phat, and  then placed on the support (188).
Let the disciple then fill the kalasha with wine, uttering meanwhile  the Mula−mantra and the Matrika Varnas,
with Vindu in Viloma order  (189). The wise one who is then himself possessed of the disposition of  the Devi
should worship the region of Fire, Sun, and Moon in the  support in the jar and in the wine in the manner
already described  (190). After decorating the jar with vermilion, red sandal paste, and a  garland of crimson
flowers, the worshipper should perform Panchikarana  (191).
Strike the wine−jar with a wisp of kusha grass, saying Phat; then,  whilst uttering the Vija Hung, veil it by the
Avagunthana Mudra, next  utter the Vaja Hring, and look with unwinking eye upon the jar, then  sprinkle the
jar with the Mantra Namah. Lastly, whilst reciting the  Mula−mantra, smell the jar three times. this is the
Panchikarama  ceremony (192).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra

Making obeisance to the jar, purify the wine therein by throwing red  flowers into it, and say the following
(193):
Mantra
Ong, O Devi Sudhe! by the Supreme Brahman, Who is One without a  second: and who is always both gross
and subtle, destroy the sin of  slaying a Brahmana which attached to thee (the wine) by the death of  Kacha
(194). O Thou Who hast Thy abode in the region of the Sun, and  Thy origin in the dwelling−place of the
Lord of Ocean (in the churning  of which thou, O Nectar! wast produced), thou who art one with the Ama
Vija, mayest Thou be freed from the curse of Shukra (195). O Devi! as  the Pranava of the Vedas is one with
the bliss of Brahman, may by that  truth be destroyed Thy sin of slaying a Brahmana.
Mantra
Hring: the Supreme Hangsa dwells in the brilliant Heaven, as Vasu It  moves throughout the space between
Heaven and Earth. It dwells on earth  in the form of the Vedic Fire, and in the Sacrificer, and is honoured  in
the Guest. It is in the household Fire and in the consciousness of  man, and dwells in the honoured region. It
resides in Truth and in the  Ether.
It is born in water, in the rays of light in Truth and in the  Eastern Hill where the Sun rises. Such is the great
Aditya, the Truth,  Which cannot be bound or concealed, the Great Consciousness Who  dwelleth everywhere
Brahman (196−197).
Exchange the vowel of the Varuna Vija for each of the long vowels,  then say "Salutation to the Devi of
Ambrosia, who is relieved of the  curse of Brahma." By the repetition of the entire Mantra seven times,  the
curse of Brahma is removed (198). Substituting in their order the  six long vowels in place of the letter o in
Angkusha, and adding  thereto the Shri and Maya Vijas, say the following:
Mantra
"Remove the curse of Krishna in the wine: pour nectar again  and again: Svaha" (199).
Having thus removed the curse of Shukra, of Brahma and of  Krishna, the worshipper should with mind
controlled worship  Ananda−Bhairava and Ananda−Bhairavi (200). The Mantra of the former is:
Mantra
"Ha−Sa−Ksha−Ma−La−Va−Ra−Yung:
Salutation to Ananda−Bhairava:  Vashat" (201);
and in the worship of the Ananda−Bhairavi the Mantra is the same,  except that its face is reversed, and in
place of its Ear the left Eye  should be placed, and then should be said:
Mantra
"Sa−Ha−Ksha−Ma−La−Va−Ra−Ying:
Salutation to the Wine Devi: Vaushat" (202).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra

Then, meditating upon the union of the Deva and Devi in the wine,  and thinking that the same is filled with
the ambrosia of such union,  japa should be made over it of the Mula−mantra twelve times (203).  Then,
considering the wine to be the Devata, handfuls of flowers should  be offered with japa of the Mula−Mantra.
Lights and incense−sticks  should be waved before it to the accompaniment of the ringing of a bell  (204).
Wine should be always thus purified in all ceremonies, whether  puja of the Devata, Vrata, Homa, marriage,
or other festivals (205).
The disciple, after placing the meat on the triangular Mandala in  front of him, should sprinkle it with the
Mantra Phat, and then charge  it thrice with the Vijas of Air and Fire (206). Let him then cover it  up with the
Gesture of the Veil, uttering the Kavacha−Mantra, and  protect it with the Weapon−Mantra Phat. Then,
uttering the Vija of  Varuna, and displaying the Dhenu−Mudra, make the meat like unto nectar  with the
following (207):
Mantra
May that Devi whose abode is in the breast of Vishnu and in the  breast of Shankara purify this my meat, and
give me a resting−place at  the excellent foot of Vishnu (208).
In a similar manner, placing the fish and sanctifying it with the  Mantras already prescribed, let the wise one
say the following Mantra  over it (208):
Mantra
"We worship the Father of the Three; He Who causes nourishment, He  Who is sweet−scented. As the fruit of
the Urvaruka is detached of  itself from the stalk on which it grows, so may He free us whilst  living from the
bond of Karmma, until we are finally liberated, and  made one with the Supreme" (210).
Then, O Beloved! the disciple should take and purify the parched  grain with the following:
Mantras
Ong! As the Eye of Heaven is plainly visible to those of the common  man, so do the Wise have constant
vision of the Excellent Foot of  Vishnu (211). The Intelligent and Prayerful, whose mind is awake and
controlled, see the most excellent Foot of Vishnu (212).
Or all the Tattvas may be consecrated by the Mula−Mantra itself. To  him who has belief in the root, of what
use are the branches and  leaves? (213).
I say that anything which is sanctified by the Mula−Mantra alone is  acceptable for the pleasure of the Devata
(214). If the time be short,  or if the disciple be pressed for time, everything should be sanctified  with the
Mula−Mantra, and offered to the Devi (215). Truly, truly, and  again truly, the ordinance of Shankara is that if
the Tattvas be so  offered, there is no sin or shortcoming (216).

 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra

SHRI DEVI said:
As Thou hast kindness for Me, pray tell Me, O Lord! more  particularly about the Pancha−tattvas and the
other observances of  which Thou hast spoken (1).
Shri Sadashiva said:
There are three kinds of wine which are excellent  namely, that  which is made from molasses, rice, or the
Madhuka flower. There are  also various other kinds made from the juice of the palmyra and date  tree, and
known by various names according to their substance and place  of production. They are all declared to be
equally appropriate in the  worship of the Devata (2).
Howsoever it may have been produced, and by whomsoever it is  brought, the wine, when purified, gives to
the worshipper all siddhi.  There are no distinctions of caste in the taking of wine so sanctified  (3). Meat,
again, is of three kinds, that of animals of the waters, of  the earth, and of the sky. From wheresoever it may
be brought, and by  whomsoever it may have been killed, it gives, without doubt, pleasure  to the Devas (4).
Let the desire of the disciple determine what should  be offered to the Devas. Whatsoever he himself likes, the
offering of  that conduces to his well−being (5). Only male animals should be  decapitated in sacrifice. It is the
command of Shambhu that female  animals should not be slain (6). There are three superior kinds of Fish
namely, Shala, Pathina and Rohita. Those which are without bones are  of middle quality, whilst those which
are full of bones are of inferior  quality. The latter may, however, if well fried, be offered to the Devi  (7−8).
There are also three kinds of parched food, superior, middle, and  inferior. The excellent and pleasing kind is
that made from Shali rice,  white as a moonbeam, or from barley or wheat, and which has been fried  in
clarified butter. The middling variety is made of fried paddy. Other  kinds of fried grain are inferior (9−10).
Meat, fish, and parched food,  fruits and roots, or anything else offered to the Devata along with  wine, are
called Shuddhi (11). O Devi! the offering of wine without  Shuddhi, as also puja and tarpana (without
Shuddhi), become fruitless,  and the Devata is not propitiated (12). The drinking of wine without  Shuddhi is
like the swallowing of poison. The disciple is ever ailing,  and lives for a short time and dies (13). O Great
Devi! when the  weakness of the Kali Age becomes great, one's own Shakti or wife should  alone be known as
the fifth Tattva. This is devoid of all defects (14).  O Beloved of My Life! in this (the last Tattva) I have
spoken of  Svayambhu and other kinds of flower. As substitutes for them, however,  I enjoin red sandal paste
(15). Neither the Tattvas nor flowers,  leaves, and fruits should be offered to the Mahadevi unless purified.
The man who offers them without purification goes to hell (16).
The Shri−patra should be placed in the company of one's own virtuous  Shakti; she should be sprinkled with
the purified wine or water from  the common offering (17). The Mantra for the sprinkling of the Shakti  is 
Mantra
Aing, Kling, Sauh. Salutation to Tripura; purify this Shakti, make  her my Shakti; Svaha (18−19).
If she who is to be Shakti is not already initiated, then the Maya  Vija should be whispered into her ear, and
other Shaktis who are  present should be worshipped and not enjoyed (20).
The worshipper should then, in the space between himself and the  Yantra, draw a triangle with the Maya Vija
in its centre, and outside  the triangle and in the order here stated a circle, a hexagon, and a  square (21). The
excellent disciple should then worship in the four  corners of the square the Pithas, Purna−shaila, Uddiyana,
Jalandhara,  and Kama−rupa, with the Mantras formed of their respective names,  preceded by Vijas formed by
the first letter of their respective names,  and followed by Namah (22).

Mantra

Then the six parts of the body should be worshipped in the six  corners of the hexagon. Then worship the
triangle, with the  Mula−Mantra, and then the Shakti of the receptacle with the Maya Vija  and Namah (23).
Wash the receptacle with the Mantra Namah, and then  place it (as in the case of the jar) on the Mandala, and
worship in it  the ten parts of Vahni with the first letters of their respective names  as Vijas (24). These parts,
which are ten in number  viz., Dhumra,  Archih, Jvalini, Sukshma, Jvalini, Vishphulingini, Sushri, Surupa,
Kapila,Havya−kavya−vaha  should be uttered in the Dative singular, and  followed by the Mantra Namah
(25−26).
Then worship the region of Vahni (in the adhara or receptacle) with  the following:
Mantra
Mang: Salutation to the region of Vahni with his ten qualities (27).
Then, taking the vessel of offering and purifying it with the Mantra  Phat, place it on the receptacle, and,
having so placed it, worship  therein the twelve parts of the Sun with the Vijas, commencing with  Ka−Bha to
Tha−Da (28). These twelve parts are  Tapini, Tapini, Dhumra,  Marichi, Jvalini, Ruchi, Sudhumra, Bhoga−da,
Vishva, Bodhini, Dharini,  Kshama (29). After this, worship the region of Sun in the vessel of  offering with
the following:
Mantra
Ang: Salutation to the circle of Sun, with His twelve parts (30).
Then the worshipper should fill the cup of offering three−quarters  full with wine taken from the jar, uttering
the Matrika Vijas in the  reverse order (31). Filling the rest of the cup with water taken from  the special
offering, let him worship with a well−controlled mind the  sixteen digits of the Moon, saying as Vijas each of
the sixteen vowels  before each of the sixteen digits spoken in the dative singular,  followed by the Mantra
Namah (32).
The sixteen desire−granting digits of Moon are  Amrita, Pranada,  Pusha, Tushti, Pushti, Rati, Dhriti, Shashini,
Chandrika, Kanti,  Jyotsna, Skri, Priti, Angada, Purna, and Purnamrita (33). As in the  case of the other Devas
mentioned, the disciple should then worship the  region of the Moon with the following:
Mantra
Ung: Salutation to the region of Moon with its sixteen digits (34).
Durva grass, sun−dried rice, red flowers, Varvara, leaf, and the  Aparajita flower should be thrown into the
vessel with the Mantra  Hring, and the sacred waters should be invoked into it (35). Then,  covering the wine
and the vessel of offering with the Avagunthana  Mudra, and uttering the Armour Vija, protect it with the
Weapon−Vija,  and converting it into ambrosia with the Dhenu−Mudra, cover it with the  Matsya−Mudra (36).
Making japa of the Mula−Mantra ten times, the  Ishta−devata should be invoked and worshipped with flowers
offered in  the joined palms.
Then charge the wine with the following five Mantras, beginning with  akhanda: (37)
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
87

Mantras
O Kula−rupini! infuse into the essence of this excellent wine which  produces full and unbroken bliss its thrill
of joy (38).
Thou who art like the nectar which is in Ananga, and art the  embodiment of Pure Knowledge, place into this
liquid the ambrosia of  Brahmananda (39).
O Thou, who art the very image of That! do Thou unite this arghya  with the image or self of That, and having
become the kulamrita,  blossom in me (40).
Bring into this sacred vessel, which is full of wine, essence of  ambrosia produced from the essence of all that
is in this world, and  containing all kinds of taste (41).
May this cup of self, which is filled with the nectar of self, Lord,  be sacrificed in the Fire of the Supreme Self
(42).
Having thus consecrated the wine with the Mantra, think of the union  in it of Sadashiva and Bhagavati and
wave lights and burning  incense−sticks before it (43).
This is the consecration of the Shri−patra in Kaulika worship.  Without such purification the disciple is guilty
of sin, and the  worship is fruitless (44). The wise one should then, according to the  rules prescribed for the
placing of the common offering, place between  the jar and the Shri−patra the cups of the Guru, the cup of
Enjoyment,  the cup of the Shakti, the cups of the Yoginis of the Vira and of  Sacrifice, and those for the
washing of the feet and the rinsing of the  mouth respectively, making nine cups in all (45−46). 
Then, filling the cups three−quarters full of wine from the jar, a  morsel of Shuddhi of the size of a pea should
be placed in each of them  (47). Then, holding the cup between the thumb and the fourth finger of  the left
hand, taking the morsel of Shuddhi in the right hand, making  the Tattva−mudra, Tarpana should be done.
This is the practice which  has been enjoined (48). Taking an excellent drop of wine from the  Shripatra and a
piece of Shuddhi, Tarpana should be made to the Deva  Ananda−Bhairava and the Devi Ananda−Bhairavi
(49). 
Then, with the wine in the cup of the Guru, offer oblations to the  line of Gurus. in the first place to the
worshipper's own Guru seated  together with his wife on the lotus of a thousand petals, and then to  the Parama
Guru, the Parapara Guru, the Parameshti Guru successively.  In offering oblations to the four Gurus, the
Vagbhava Vija should first  be pronounced, followed in each case by the names of each of the four  Gurus
(50). Then, with wine from the cup of enjoyment, the worshipper  should, in the lotus of his heart, offer
oblations to the Adya−Kali. In  this oblation Her own Vija should precede, and Svaha should follow Her
name. This should be done thrice (51).
Next, with wine taken from the cup of the Shakti, oblation should be  similarly offered to the Devata of the
parts of Her body and their  Avarana−Devatas (52). Then, with the wine in the cup of the Yogini,  oblation
should be offered to the Adya−Kalika, carrying all Her weapons  and with all Her followers.
Then should follow the sacrifice to the Vatukas (53). The wise  worshipper should draw on his left an ordinary
rectangular figure, and  after worshipping it, place therein food with wine, meat, and other  things (54). With
the Vijas of Vak, Maya, Kamala, and with the Mantra:
"Vang, Salutation to Vatuka," he should be worshipped in the East of  the rectangle, and then sacrifice should
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantras

be offered to him (55).
Then, with the
Mantra
"Yang to the Yogin is Svaha,"
sacrifice should be made to the Yoginis on the South (56), and then  to Kshetra−pala on the West of the
rectangle, with the
Mantra
"To Kshetra−pala namah,"
preceded by the letter Ksha, to which in succession the six long  vowels are added with the Vindu (57).
Following this, sacrifice should  be made to Gana−pati on the North, adding to Ga the six long vowels in
succession with the Vindu thereon, followed by the name of Ganesha in  the dative singular, and ending with
Svaha. Lastly, sacrifice should be  made inside the rectangle to all Bhutas, according to proper form  (58−59).
Uttering "Hring, Shring, Sarvva−vighna−kridbhyah," add  "Sarvva−bhutebhyah," and then "Hung Phat
Svaha;" this is how the Mantra  is formed (60). Then a sacrifice to Shiva should be made with the  following:
Mantra
Ong, O Dev! O Shiva, O Exalted One, Thou art the image of the final  conflagration at the dissolution of
things, deign to accept this  sacrifice, and to reveal clearly to me the good and evil which is my  destiny. To
Shiva I bow.
This is the Mula−Mantra in the worship of Shiva.
Having said this, perform the sacrifice, saying, "This is Thy Vali.  To Shiva, Namah. O Holy One! I have now
described to Thee the mode of  formation of the circle of worship (and the placing of the cup and  other rites)
(61−62). Then, making with the two hands the  Kachchhapa−Mudra, let the worshipper take up with his hands
a beautiful  fiower scented with sandal, fragrant aloes, and musk, and, carrying it  to the lotus of his heart, let
him meditate therein (in the lotus) upon  the most supreme Adya (63−64).
Then let him lead the Devi along the Sushumna Nadi, which is the  highway of Brahman to the great Lotus of
a thousand petals, and there  make Her joyful. Then, bringing Her through his nostrils, let him place  Her on
the flower (her presence being communicated) as it were, by one  light to another, and place the flower on the
Yantra and with folded  hands pray with all devotion to his Ishta−devata thus (65−66):
Mantra
O Queen of the Devas! Thou who art easily attained by devotion.  Remain here, I pray Thee, with all Thy
following, the while I worship  Thee (67).
Then, uttering the Vija Kring, say the following:
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
89

Mantra
O Adya Devi Kalika! come here with all Thy following, come here (and  then say), stay here, stay here (68);
(and then say) place Thyself  here, (and then say) be Thou detained here. Accept my worship (69).
Having thus invoked (the Devi) into the Yantra, the Vital Airs of  the Devi should be infused therein by the
following pratishtha Mantra  (70):
Mantra
Ang, Hring, Krong, Shring, Svaha; may the five Vital Airs of this  Devata be here: Ang, Hring, Krong,
Shring, Svaha (71). Her Jiva is here  placed  Ang, Hring, Krong, Shring, Svaha  all senses  Ang, Hring,  Krong,
Shring, Svaha. Speech, mind, sight, smell, hearing, touch, and  the Vital Airs of the Adya−Kali Devata, may
they come here and stay  happily here for ever. Svaha (72−74).
Having recited the above three times, and having in due form placed  the Vital Airs (of the Devi) in the Yantra
with the Lelihina−Mudra,  with folded palms, he (the worshipper) should say (75):
Mantra
O Adya Kali! hast Thou had a good journey, hast Thou had a good  journey? O Parameshvari! mayest Thou
be seated on this seat (76)?
Then, whilst repeating the primary Mantra, sprinkle thrice the water  of the special oblation over the Devi, and
then make Nyasa of the Devi  with the six parts of Her body. This ceremony is called Sakalikarama or
Sakalikriti. Then worship the Devi with all the sixteen offerings (77).  These are: water for washing the feet,
the water for the offering,  water for rinsing the mouth and for Her bath, garments, jewels,  perfume, flowers,
incense−sticks, lights, food, water for washing the  mouth, nectar, pan, water of oblation, and obeisance. In
worship these sixteen offerings are needed (78−79).
Uttering the Adya Vija, and then saying "this water is for washing  the feet of the (Adya). To the Devata
Namah," offer the water at the  feet of the Devi. Similarly with the word Svaha, in place of Namah, the
offering should be placed at the head of the Devi (80). Then the wise  worshipper with Svadha should offer
the water for rinsing the mouth to  the mouth of the Devi, and then the worshipper should offer to the
lotus−mouth of the Devi Madhu−parka with the Mantra Svadha. He should  then offer water to rinse the
mouth (a second time) with the Mantra  "Vang Svadha" (81). Then the worshipper, saying:
Mantra
Hring, Shring, Kring, Parameshvari, Svaha: I offer this water for  bathing, this apparel, these jewels, to the
Supreme Devi, the  Primordial Kalika. Svaha,
make an offer of them to all parts of the body of the Devi (82).
Then the worshipper should, with the same Mantra, but ending with  Namah, offer scent with his middle and
third finger to the heart−lotus  (of the Devi), and with the same Mantra, but ending with Vaushat, he  should
similarly offer to Her flowers (83). Having placed the burning  incense and lighted lamp in front of Devi, and
sprinkling them with  water, they should be given away with the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
90

Mantra
Hring, Shring, Kring, Parameshvari, Svaha: This incense−stick and  light I humbly offer to Adya−Kalika.
Svaha.
After worship of the Bell with the
Mantra
O Mother, Who produces the sound which proclaims triumph to Thee.  Svaha,
he should ring it with his left hand, and, taking up the  incense−stick with his right hand, he should wave it up
to the nostrils  of the Devi. Then, placing the incense−stick on Her left, he should  raise and wave the light ten
times up to and before the eyes of the  Devi (84−86). Then, taking the Cup and the Shuddhi in his two hands,
the worshipper should, whilst uttering the Mula−Mantra, offer them to  the centre of the Yantra (87).
Mantra
O Thou who hast brought to an end a crore of kalpas, take this  excellent wine, as also the Shuddhi, and grant
to me endless liberation  (88).
Then, drawing a figure (in front of the Yantra), according to the  rules of ordinary worship, place the plate
with food thereon (89).  Sprinkle the food (with the Mantra Phat) and veil it with the  Avagunthana−Mudra
(and the Mantra Hung), and then again protect it (by  the Mantra Phat) (Saying Vang), and, exhibiting the
Dhenu−Mudra over  it, make it into the food of immortality. Then, after recitation of the  Mula−Mantra seven
times, it should be oftered to the Devi with the  water taken from the vessel of offering (90).
The worshipper, after reciting the Mula−Mantra, should say: "This  cooked food, with all other necessaries, I
offer to the Adya−Kali, my  Ishta−devi." He should then say: "O Shiva! partake of this offering"  (91). Then he
should make the Devi eat the offering by means of the  five Mudras called Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana, and
Udana (90).
Next, form with the left hand the Naivedya−Mudra, which is like a  full−blown lotus. Then, whilst reciting the
Mula−Mantra, give away the  jar with wine to the Devi for Her to drink. After that offer again  water for
rinsing the mouth, and following that a threefold oblation  should be made to the Devi with wine from the cup
of the Shri−patra  (93−94). Then, reciting the Mula−Mantra, let the worshipper offer five  handfuls of flowers
to the head, heart, Muladhara Lotus, the feet, and  all parts of the body of the Devi (95), and thereafter with
folded  palms he should pray to his Ishta−devata thus:
Mantra
O Ishta−devata! I am now worshipping the Devatas who surround thee,  namah (96).
The six parts of the body of the Devi should then be worshipped at  the four corners of the Yantra, and in front
and behind it in their  order; and then the line of Gurus should be worshipped (97). Then, with  scent and
flowers, worship the four Kula−gurus  namely, Guru,  Parama−guru, Parapara−guru, Parameshti−guru (98).
Then, with the wine in the cup of the Guru, make three Tarpanas to  each, and on the lotus of eight petals
worship the eight Mother Nayikas  namely, Mangala, Vijaya, Bhadra, Jayanti, Aparajita, Nandini,  Narasinghi,
and Kaumari (99−100), and on the tips of the petals worship  the eight Bhairavas  Asitanga, Ruru, Chanda,
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
91

Krodhonmatta, Bhayangkara,  Kapali, Bhishana, and Sanghara (101−102). Indra and the other Dik−palas
should be worshipped in the Bhu−pura, and their weapons outside the  Bhu−pura, and then Tarpana should be
made to them (103).
After worshipping (the Devi) with all the offerings, sacrifice  should be carefully made to Her (104). The ten
approved beasts which  may be sacrificed are  deer, goat, sheep, buffalo, hog, porcupine,  hare, iguana, and
rhinoceros (105); but other beasts may also be  sacrificed if the worshipper so desires (106). The worshipper
versed in  the rules of sacrifice should select a beast with good signs, and,  placing it before the Devi, should
sprinkle it with the water from the  Vishesharghya, and by the Dhenu−Mudra should make it into nectar.
Let him then worship the goat (sheep, or whatever other animal is  being sacrificed) with (the Mantra)
"Namah to the goat," which is a  beast, and with perfumes, flowers, vermilion, food, and water. Then he
should whisper into the ears of the beast the Gayatri Mantra, which  severs the bond of its life as a beast
(107−108). The Pashu−Gayatri,  which liberates a beast from its life of a beast, is as follows: After  the word
"Pashu−pashaya" say " Vidmahe," then, after the word  "Vishva−karmane," say "Dhimahi," and then "Tanno
jivah prachodayat."
Mantra
Let us bring to mind the bonds of the life of a beast. Let us  meditate upon the Creator of the Universe. May
He liberate us from out  of this life (of a beast) (109−110).
Then, taking the sacrificial knife, the excellent worshipper should  worship it with the Vija "Hung," and
worship Sarasvati and Brahma at  its end, Lakshmi and Narayana at its middle, and Uma and Maheshvara at
the handle (111−112). Then the sacrificial knife should be worshipped  with the
Mantra
Namah to the sacrificial knife infused with the presence of Brahma,  Vishnu, Shiva, and their Shaktis (113).
Then, dedicating it with the Great Word, he should, with folded  hands, say: "May this dedication to Thee be
according to the ordained  rites" (114).
Having thus offered the beast to the Devi, it should be placed on  the ground (115). The worshipper then, with
mind intent upon the Devi,  should sever the head of the beast with one sharp stroke. This may be  done either
by the worshipper himself or by his brother, brother's son,  a friend, or a kinsman, but never by one who is an
enemy (116). The  blood, when yet warm, should be offered to the Vatukas. Then the head  with a light on it
should be offered to the Devi with the following:
Mantra
"This head with the light upon it I offer to the Devi with obeisance  " (117).
This is the sacrificial rite of the Kaulikas in Kaula worship. If it  be not observed, the Devata is never pleased
(118). After this Homa  should be performed. Listen, O Beloved One! to the rules which relate  to it (119). The
worshipper should, with sand, make on his right a  square, each side of which is one cubit. Let him, then,
while reciting  the Mula−Mantra, gaze at it, stroke it with a wisp of kusha grass,  uttering the Weapon−Vija,
and then sprinkle it with water to the  accompaniment of the same Vija (120).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
92

Then, veiling it with the Kurchcha−Vija, he should say: "Obeisance  to the sthandila of the Devi," and with
this Mantra worship the square  (121). Then, inside the square three lines should be drawn from East to  West,
and three lines from South to North, of the length of a pradesha.  When this has been done, the (following
Devatas, whose names are  hereinafter given) should be worshipped over these lines (122). Over  the lines
from West to East worship Mukunda, Isha, and Purandara: over  the lines from South to North, Brahma,
Vaivasvata, and Indu (123).
Then a triangle should be drawn within the square, and within the  triangle the Vija Hsauh should be written.
Outside the triangle draw a  hexagon, outside this a cirde, and outside the circle a lotus with  eight petals, and
outside this a (square) Bhu−pura, with four  entrances; so should the wise one draw the excellent Yantra
(124).  Having worshipped with the Mula−Mantra and with offerings of handfuls  of flowers, the space thus
marked off and washed, the articles for the  Homa sacrifice with the Pranava, the intelligent one, should, after
first uttering the Maya Vija, worship in the pericarp of the lotus the  Adhara−shakti and others, either
individually or collectively (125).  Piety, Knowledge, Dispassion, and Dominion should be worshipped in the
Agni, Ishana, Vayu, and Nairrita corners of the Yantra respectively,  and the negation of the qualities in the
East, North, West, and South  respectively, and in the centre Ananta and Padma (126−127). Then let  him
worship Sun with his twelve parts, and Moon with her sixteen  digits, and, on the filament commencing from
the East, worship Pita,  and then Shveta, Aruna, Krishna, Dhumra, Tibra, Sphulingini,  Ruchira, in their order,
and in the centre Jvalini (128−129). In all  worship Pranava should commence the Mantra, and Namah should
end it.  The seat of Fire should be worshipped with the
Mantra
Rang, Salutation to the seat of Fire.
Then the Mantrin should meditate upon the Devi Sarasvati after She  has bathed, with eyes like the blue lotus
on the seat of Fire in the  embrace of Vagishvara, and worship in the seat of Fire with the  Maya−Vija (130).
Then let him bring Fire in the manner prescribed, and gaze intently  on it, and, whilst repeating the
Mula−Mantra, invoke Vahni into it with  the Mantra Phat (131−132). Then the seat of Fire should be
worshipped  in the Yantra with the
Mantra
Ong Salutation to the Yoga−pitha of Fire,
and on the four sides, beginning on the East and ending on the  South, Vama, Jyeshtha, Raudri, Ambika,
should be worshipped in the  order given (133).
Then the marked−off space should be worshipped with the
Mantra
Salutation to the sthandila of the revered Devata, the Primeval  Kalika:
and then within this place the worshipper should meditate upon the  Devi Vagishvari under the form of the
Mula−Devata. After lighting the  Fire with the Vija Rang, and reciting the Mula−Mantra, and then the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
93

Mantra
Hung Phat: to the eaters of raw flesh: Svaha,
the share of the raw meat eaters (Rakshasas) should be put aside.  Gaze at the Fire, saying the
Weapon−Mantra, and surround it with the  Veil Mudra, uttering the Vija Hung (134−136). Make the Fire into
nectar  with the Dhenu−Mudra. Take some Fire in both palms, and wave it thrice  in a circle over the sthandila
from right to left. Then with both knees  on the ground, and meditating on Fire as the male seed of Shiva, the
worshipper should place it into that portion of the Yoni Yantra which  is nearest him (137−138). Then, first,
worship the Image of Fire with  the
Mantra
Hring, Salutation to the Image of Fire,
and after that the Spirit of Fire with the
Mantra
Rang: to the Spirit of Fire namah (139).
The Mantrin will then think in his mind of the awakened form of  Vahni, and kindle the fire with the
following (140)
Mantra
Ong, yellow Spirit of Fire, which knows all, destroy, destroy, burn,  burn, ripen, ripen command: Svaha.
This is the Mantra for kindling Fire. After this, with folded hands,  Fire should again be adored (141−142).
Mantra
I adore the kindled Fire of the colour of gold, free from impurity,  burning, author of the Veda the devourer of
oblations, which faces  every quarter (143).
After adoration of Fire in this manner, cover the marked−off space  with kusha grass, and then the worshipper,
giving Fire the name of his  own, Ishta−devata, should worship him (144).
Mantra
Ong,O Red−eyed One! Vaishvanara, origin of the Veda, come here,  come, come here, (help me to)
accomplish all (my) works: Svaha.
Then the seven Tongues of Fire, Hiranya and others, should be  worshipped (145−146). The worshipper
should next adore the six Limbs of  Vahni uttering the word "of a thousand rays" in the dative singular,  and at
the end "obeisance to the heart" (147).
Then the wise one should worship the forms of Vahni (147), the eight  forms Jata−veda and others (148), and
then the eight Shaktis  namely,  Brahmi and others, the eight Nidhis  namely, Padma and others, and the  ten
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
94

Dik−palas  namely, Indra and others (149).
After worshipping the thunderbolt and other weapons, the sacrificer  should take two blades of kusha grass of
the length of the space  between his stretched−out thumb and forefinger, and place them  lengthwise in the
ghee (150). He should meditate on the Nadi Ida in the  left part of the ghee, and on the Nadi Pingala in the
right portion,  and on the Nadi Sushumna in the centre, and with a well−controlled mind  take ghee from the
right side, and offer it to the right eye of Vahni  with the following:
Mantra
Ong to Agni Svaha.
Then, taking ghee from the left side, offer it to the left eye of  Vahni with the
Mantra
Ong to Soma Svaha (151−153).
Then, taking ghee from the middle portion, offer it to the forehead  of Vahni with the
Mantra
Ong to Agni and Soma Svaha (154).
Then, saying namah, take the ghee again from the right side, say  first the Pranava, and then
Mantra
To Agni the Svishti−krit Svaha.
With this Mantra he should offer oblation to the mouth of Vahni.  Then, uttering the Vyahriti with the Pranava
at the commencement, and  Svaha at the end, the Homa sacrifice should be performed (155−156).  Then he
should offer oblations thrice with the
Mantra
Om,O Vaishvanara, origin of the Veda, come hither, come hither, O  Red−eyed One! and fulfil all my works
(157)
Then, invoking the Ishta−Devata with the proper Mantra into the  Fire, let him worship Her and the
Pitha−Devata. Twenty−five oblations  should then be offered (uttering the Mula−Mantra with Svaha at the
end), and, contemplating on the union (or identity) of his own soul  with Vahni and the Devi, eleven oblations
should also be offered with  the Mula−Mantra to the Anga−Devatas, concluding with Svaha (158−159).
Then, with a mixture of ghee, tila−seed, honey, or with flowers and  bael−leaves, or with (other prescribed)
articles, oblation should be  made for the attainment of one's desire. This oblation should be made  not less
than eight times, and with every attention and care (160−161).  Then, reciting the primary Mantra ending with
Svaha, complete oblation  should be made (with a full ladle) with fruits and leaves. The  worshipper, with the
Sanghara−Mudra, transferring the Devi from the  Fire to the lotus of his heart (162), should then say "Pardon
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra

me," and  dismiss Him who feeds on oblations. Then, distributing presents, the  Mantrin should consider that
the Homa has been duly performed (163).
Then the excellent worshipper should place between the eyebrows what  is left over of the oblations (164).
This is the ordinance relating to  Homa in all forms of Agama worship. After performance of Homa the
worshipper should proceed to do japa (165). Now, listen,O Devi! to the  instructions which relate to japa by
which the Vidya is pleased. During  japa, the Devata, the Guru, and the Mantra should be considered as one
(166). The letters of the Mantra are the Devata, and the Devata is in  the form of the Guru. To him who
worships them as one and the same, his  is the greatest success (167).
The worshipper should then meditate upon his Guru as being in his  head, the Devi in his heart, the
Mula−Mantra in the form of tejas on  his tongue, and himself as united with the glory of all three (168).  Then,
adding the Tara to the beginning and the end of the Mula−Mantra,  it should be made japa of seven times, and
then it should be  recapitulated with the Matrika Vija at its beginning and end (169). The  wise worshipper
should make japa of the Maya−Vija over his head ten  times, and of the Pranava ten times over his mouth, and
of the  Maya−Vija again seven times in the lotus of his heart, and then perform  Pranayama (170).
Then, taking a rosary of coral, etc, let him worship it thus:
Mantra
O rosary,O rosary,O great rosary, thou art the image of all Shaktis.  Thou art the repository of the fourfold
blessings. Do thou therefore be  the giver to me of all success.
Having thus worshipped the Mala, and also made Tarpana to it thrice  with wine taken from the Shri−patra,
accompanied by recitation of the  Mula−Mantra, the worshipper should, with well−controlled mind, make
japa one thousand and eight, or at least one hundred and eight times  (171−173). Then, doing Pranayama, he
should offer on the left  lotus−hand of the Devi the fruit of his japa, whose form is Tejas,  together with water
and flowers from the Shri−patra, and, bowing down  his head to the ground, say the following:
Mantra
O Great Queen! Thou Who protectest that which is most secret, deign  to accept this my recitation. May by
Thy grace success attend my effort.
After this, let him with folded hands recite the hymn and the  protective Mantra (174−176). Then the Sadhaka
should, with the special  oblation in his hand, going round the Devi, keeping Her to his right,  say the
following, and dedicate his own self by offering Vilomarghya  (177).
Mantra
Om, whatsoever ere this I in the possession of life, intelligence,  body, or in action, awake, in dream or
dreamless sleep have done,  whether by word or deed, by my hands, feet, belly, or organ of  generation,
whatsoever I have remembered or spoken  of all that I make  an offering to Brahman. I and all that is mine I
lay at the lotus−feet  of the Adya Kali. I make the sacrifice of myself Ong tat sat (178−179).
Then, with folded hands, let him supplicate his Ishta−Devata, and  reciting the Maya−Mantra, say:
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
96

Mantra
"O Primordial Kalika! I have worshipped Thee with all my powers and  devotion,"
and then saying, "Forgive me," let him bid the Devi go. Let him with  his hands formed into Sanghara−Mudra
take up a flower, smell it, and  place it on his heart (182−183). A triangular figure well and clearly  made
should next be drawn in the North−East corner, and there he should  worship the Devi Nirmalya−vasini with
the
Mantra
Hring salutation to the Devi Nirmalya−vasini (184).
Then, distributing Naivedya to Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, and all  the other Devas, the worshipper should
partake of it (185). Then,  placing his Shakti on a separate seat to his left, or on the same seat  with himself, he
should make a pleasing drink in the cup (186), The cup  should be so formed as to hold not more than five and
not less than  three tolas of wine, and may be of either gold or silver (187), or  crystal, or made of the shell of a
cocoa−nut. It should be kept on a  support on the right side of the plate containing the prepared food  (188).
Then the wise one should serve the sacred food and wine either  himself or by his brother's sons among the
worshippers according to the  order of their seniority (189). The purified wine should be served in  the
drinking−cups, and the purified food in plates kept for that  purpose, and then should food and drink be taken
with such as are  present at the time (190). First of all, some purified food should be  eaten to make a bed as it
were (for the wine which is to be drunk). Let  the assembled worshippers then joyously take up each his own
cup filled  with excellent nectar.
Then let him take up each his own cup and meditate upon the  Kula−Kundalini, who is the Chit, and who is
spread from the Muladhara  lotus to the tip of the tongue, and, uttering the Mula−Mantra, let  each, after taking
the others' permission, offer it as oblation to the  mouth of the Kundali (191−193). When the Shakti is of the
household,  the smelling of the wine is the equivalent of drinking it. Worshippers  who are householders may
drink five cups only (194). Excessive drinking  prevents the attainment of success by Kula worshippers (195).
They may drink until the sight or the mind is not affected. To drink  beyond that is bestial (196). How is it
possible for a sinner who  becomes a fool through drink and who shows contempt for the Sadhaka of  Shakti to
say "I worship the Adya Kalika"? (197). As touch cannot  affect food, etc, offered to Brahman, so there is no
distinction of  caste in food offered to Thee (198).
As I have directed, so should eating and drinking be done. After  partaking of food offeredto Thee, the hands
should not be washed, but  with a piece of cloth or a little water remove that which has adhered  to the hands
(199). Lastly, after placing a flower from the nirmalya on  his head, and wearing a tilaka mark made from the
remnants of the  oblation on the Yantra between his eyebrows, the intelligent worshipper  may roam the earth
like a Deva (200).

PARVATI was pleased at hearing the revelation of the auspicious  Mantra of the Adya Kalika, which yields
abundant blessings, is the only  means of attaining to a knowledge of the Divine essence, and leads to
liberation; as also at hearing of the morning rites, the rules relating  to bathing, Sandhya, the purification of
Bhang, the methods of external  and internal Nyasa and worship, the sacrifice of animals, Homa, the
formation of the circle of worship, and the partaking of the holy food.  Bowing low with modesty, the Devi
questioned Shankara (1−3).
Shri Devi said:
O Sadashiva! Lord, and Benefactor of the Universe, Thou hast in Thy  mercy spoken of the mode of worship
of the supreme Prakriti (4), which  benefits all being, is the sole path both for enjoyment and final  liberation,
and which gives, in this Age, in particular, immediate  success (5). My mind, immersed in the ocean of the
nectar of Thy word,  has no desire to rise therefrom, but craves for more and more (6). O  Deva, in the
directions Thou hast given relating to the worship of the  great Devi, Thou hast but given a glimpse of the
hymn of praise, and of  the protective Mantra. Do Thou reveal them now (7).
Shri Sadashiva said:
Listen, then, O Devi, Who art the adored of the worlds,to this  unsurpassed hymn, by the reciting of or
listening to which one becomes  the Lord of all the Siddhis (8), (a hymn) which allays evil fortune,  increases
happiness and prosperity, destroys untimely death, and  removes all calamities (9), and is the cause of the
happy approach to  the gracious Adya Kalika. It is by the grace of this hymn,O Happy One,  that I am Tripurari
(10).
O Devi! the Rishi of this hymn is Sadashiva, its metre is Anushtup,  its Devata is the Adya Kalika, and the
object of its use is the  attainment of Dharmma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha (11).

(To Thee I make obeisance.) 
These are proclaimed as the Hundred Names of Kalika (32), beginning  with the letter Ka. They are all
identical with the image of Kali (33).  He who in worship recites these names with his mind fixed on Kalika,
for him Mantra−siddhi is quickly obtained, and with him Kali is pleased  (34). By the mere bidding of his
Guru he acquires intelligence,  knowledge, and becomes wealthy, famous, munificent, and compassionate
(35). Such an one enjoys life happily in this world with his children  and grandchildren with wealth and
dominion (36). He who, on a new moon  night, when it falls on Tuesday, worships the great Adya Kali,
Mistress  of the three worlds, with the five Ma−karas, and repeats Her hundred  names, becomes suffused with
the presence of the Devi, and for him  there remains nothing in the three worlds which is beyond his powers
(37−38).
He becomes in learning like Brihaspati himself, in wealth like  Kuvera. His profundity is that of the ocean,
and his strength that of  the wind (39). He shines with the blinding brilliance of the Sun, yet  pleases with the
soft glamour of the Moon. In beauty he becomes like  the God of Love, and reaches the hearts of women (40).
He comes forth  as conqueror everywhere by the grace of this hymn of praise. Singing  this hymn, he attains all
his desires (41). All these desires he shall  attain by the grace of the gracious Adya, whether in battle, in
seeking  the favour of Kings, in wagers, or in disputes, and when his life be in  danger (42), at the hands of
robbers, amidst burning villages, lions,  or tigers (43), in forests and lonely deserts, when imprisoned,
threatened by Kings or adverse planets, in burning fever, in long  sickness, when attacked by fearful disease
(44), in the sickness of  children caused by the influence of adverse planets, or when tormented  by evil
dreams, when fallen in boundless waters, and when he be in some  storm−tossed ship (45).
O Devi! he who with firm devotion meditates upon the Parama  Mayaimage of the most excellent Kaliis
without a doubt relieved of all  dangers. For him there is never any fear, whether arising from sin or  disease
(46−47). For him there is ever victory, and defeat never. At  the mere sight of him all dangers flee (48). He

expounds all  Scriptures, enjoys all good fortune, and becomes the leader in all  matters of caste and duty,and
the lord among his kinsmen (49). In his  mouth Vani ever abides, and in his home Kamala. Men bow with
respect at  the mere mention of his name (50). The eight Siddhis, such as Anima and  others, he looks upon as
but mere bits of grass.
I have now recited the hymn of a hundred names, which is called "The  Very Form of the Adya Kali" (51).
Purashcharana of this hymn, which is its repetition one hundred and  eight times, yields all desired fruit (52).
This hymn of praise of a  hundred names, which is the Primeval Kali Herself, if read, or caused  to be read, if
heard, or caused to be heard, frees from all sins and  leads to union with Brahman (53−54).
Shri Sadashiva said.
I have spoken of the great hymn of the Prakriti of the Supreme  Brahman, hear now the protective Mantra of
the sacred Adya Kalika (55).  The name of the Mantra is "Conqueror of the three Worlds," its Rishi is  Shiva,
the verse is Anushtup, and its Devata the Adya Kali (56).
Its Vija is the Maya Vija, its Shakti is Kama Vija, and its Kilaka  is Kring. It should be used for the attainment
of all desired objects  (57).
The Protective Mantra
(Known As Trailokya−Vijaya)
Hring, may the Adya protect my head; 
Shring, may Kali protect my face; 
Kring, may the Supreme Shakti protect my heart; 
May She Who is the Supreme of the Supreme protect my throat (58); 
May Jagaddhatri protect my two eyes; 
May Shankari protect my two ears; 
May Mahamaya protect my power of smell; 
May Sarvva−mangala protect my taste (58); 
May Kaumari protect my teeth; 
May Kamalalaya protect my cheeks; 
May Kshama protect my upper and lower lips; 
May Charu−hasini protect my chin (60); 
May Kuleshani protect my neck; 
May Kripa−mayi protect the nape of my neck; 
May Bahu−da protect my two arms; 
May Kaivalya−dayini protect my two hands; (61) 
May Kapardini protect my shoulders; 
May Trailokya−tarini protect my back; 
May Aparna protect my two sides; 
May Kamathasana protect my hips (62); 
May Vishalakshi protect my navel; 
May Prabha−vati protect my organ of generation; 
May Kalyani protect my thighs; 
May Parvati protect my feet; 
May Jaya−durga protect my vital breaths, 
And Sarvva−siddhi−da protect all parts of my body (63). 
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
The Protective Mantra
101

As to those parts as have not been mentioned in the Kavacha, and are  unprotected, may the Eternal Primeval
Kali protect all such (64).
I have now spoken to Thee of the wonderful heavenly Protective  Mantra of the Adya Devi Kalika, which is
known as the "Conqueror of the  three Worlds" (65).
He who repeats it at his devotions with his mind fixed upon the Adya  obtains all his desires, and She
becomes propitious unto him (66). He  quickly attains Mantra−siddhi. The lesser siddhis become, as it were,
his slaves (67). He who is childless gets a son, he who desires wealth  gains riches. The seeker of learning
attains it, and whatsoever a man  desires he attains the same (68).
The Purashcharana of this Protective Mantra is its repetition a  thousand times, and this gives the desired fruit
(69). If it be written  on birch−bark, with the paste of sandal, fragrant aloe, musk, saffron,  or red sandal, and
encased in a golden ball, worn either on the right  arm, round the neck, in the crown lock, or round the waist,
then the  Adya Kali becomes devoted to its wearer, and grants him whatsoever he  may desire (70−71).
Nowhere has he fear. In all places he is a  conqueror. He becomes ready of speech, free from ailments,
long−lived  and strong, endowed with all power of endurance (72), and an adept in  all learning. He knows the
meaning of all Scriptures, has Kings under  his control, and holds both pleasure and emancipation in the
hollow of  his hand (73).
For men affected with the taint of the Kali Age it is a most  excellent Mantra for the attainment of final
liberation  (74).
Shri Devi said:
Thou hast, O Lord! in Thy kindness told me of the Hymn and  Protective Mantra; I now desire to hear of the
rules relating to  Purashcharana (75).
Shri Sadashiva said:
The rules relating to Purashcharana in the worship of the Adya  Kalika are the same as those relating to the
Purashcharana in the  worship with the Brahma−Mantra (76). For Sadhakas who are unable to do  them
completely, both Japa, Puja and Homa, and Purashcharana may be  curtailed (77), since it is better to observe
these rites on a small  scale than not to observe them at all. Now listen, O Gentle One! the  while I describe to
Thee the shortened form of worship (78). Let the  wise one rinse his mouth with the Mula−Mantra, and then
perform  Rishi−nyasa. Let him purify the palms of the hands, and proceed to  Kara−nyasa and Anga−nyasa
(79). Passing the hands all over the body,  let him practise Pranayama, and then meditate, worship, and
inwardly  recite. This is the ceremonial for the shortened form of worship (80).
In this form of worship, in lieu of Homa and other rites, the  Mantras may be recited four times the number
prescribed in the case of  each of them respectively (81). There is also another mode of  performance. A person
who, when the fourteenth day of the dark half of  the month falls on a Tuesday or Saturday, worships
Jaganmayi with the  five elements of worship, and recites with fully attentive mind the  Mantra ten thousand
times at midnight and feasts believers in the  Brahman has performed Purashcharana (82−83). From one
Tuesday to  another Tuesday the Mantra should every day be inwardly recited a  thousand times. The Mantra
thus recited eight thousand times is equal  to the performance of Purashcharana (84−85).
In all Ages, O Devi! but particularly in the Kali Age, the Mantras  of the Sacred Primeval Kalika are of great
efficacy, and yield complete  success (85−86). O Parvati! In the Kali Age, Kali in her various forms  is ever
watchful, but when the Kali Age is in full sway, then the form  of Kali Herself is for the benefit of the world
(87). In initiation  into this Kalika Mantra there is no necessity to determine whether it  be siddha or su−siddha,
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
The Protective Mantra
102

or the like, or favourable or inimical. If japa  is made of it, which is both niyama and a−niyama, the Adya
Devi is  pleased (88). The mortal, by the grace of the glorious Adya, attains a  knowledge of the divine
essence, and, possessed of such knowledge, is,  without a doubt, liberated even while living (89). Beloved,
there is no  need here for over−exertion or endurance or penances. The religious  exercises of the worshippers
of the Adya Kali are pleasant to  accomplish (90). By the mere purification of the heart the worshipper  attains
all that he desires (91). So long, however, as the heart is not  purified, so long must the worshipper practise the
rites with devotion  to Kula. (92)
The carrying out of the practices ordained produces purification of  the heart. The Mantra should, however,
first be received from the mouth  of the Guru in the case of the Brahma−Mantra (93). O Great Queen!
Purashkriya should be done after the performance of the necessary  worship and of other prescribed rites. In
the purified heart knowledge  of Brahman grows. And when knowledge of Brahman is attained, there is
neither that which should, nor that which should not, be done (94).
Shri Parvati said:
O Great Deva! what is Kula, and what is Kulachara? O Great Lord!  what is the sign of each of the five
elements of worship? I desire to  hear the truth relating to these (95).
Shri Sadashiva said:
Thou hast asked well, O Lady of the Kulas. Thou art indeed the  Benefactress of the worshippers. Listen! For
Thy pleasure I shall  accurately describe to Thee these things (96). The Kula are Jiva,  Prakriti, space, time,
ether, earth, water, fire, and air (97). O  Primeval One! the realization that all this is one with Brahman is
Kulachara, and produces Dharmma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha (98). Those  whose sins are washed away by
merits acquired in various previous  births by penances, alms, and faithful observance of worship, it is  they
whose minds are inclined in Kaulika worship (99). When the  intelligence realizes the essence of Kaulika
worship, it becomes at  once purified, and the mind inclines to the lotus−feet of the Primeval  Kali (100). The
excellent worshipper versed in Kaula doctrine who has  received this most excellent Vidya by the service of a
good spiritual  teacher, if he remains firmly attached to Kaulika worship and to the  worship with the five
elements of the Primeval Kalika, the Patron Devi  of Kula, will enjoy a multitude of blessings in this life, and
attain  final liberation at its close. (102)
The characteristic of the first element is that it is the great  medicine for humanity, helping it to forget deep
sorrows, and is the  cause of joy (103). But, O Dearest One! the element which is not  purified stupefies and
bewilders, breeds disputes and diseases, and  should be rejected by the Kaulas (104). Beasts bred in villages,
in the  air, or forest, which are nourishing, and increase intelligence,  energy, and strength, are the second
element (105). O Beautiful One! of  the animals bred in water, that which is pleasing and of good taste,  and
increases the generative power of man, is the third element (106).  The characteristics of the fourth element
are that it is easily  obtainable, grown in the earth, and is the root of the life of the  three worlds (107). And, O
Devi, the signs of the fifth element are  that it is the cause of intense pleasure to all living things, is the  origin
of all creatures, and the root of the world which is without  either beginning or end (108). Know, Dearest One!
that the first  element is fire, the second is air, the third is water, the fourth is  the earth (109), and, O
Beauteous Face! as to the fifth element, know  it to be ether, the support of the Universe (110). O Sovereign
Mistress  of Kula, he who knows Kula, the five Kula−tattvas, and Kula worship, is  liberated whilst yet living
(111).

Chapter 8  − The Dharmma and Customs  of the Castes and
Ashramas
AFTER hearing of the various forms of Dharmma, Bhavani, Mother of  the worlds, Destructress of all worldly
bonds, spoke again to Shankara  (1).
Shri Devi said:
I have heard of the different Dharmma, which bring happiness in this  world and the next, and bestow piety,
wealth, fulfilment of desire,  ward off danger, and are the cause of union with the Supreme (2). I  wish now to
hear of the castes and of the stages of life. Speak in Thy  kindness, O Omnipresent One! of these, and of the
mode of life which  should be observed therein (3).
Shri Sadashiva said:
O Thou of auspicious Vows! in the Satya and other Ages there were  four castes; in each of these were four
stages of life, and the rules  of conduct varied according to the caste and stages of life. In the  Kali Age,
however, there are five castesnamely, Brahmana, Kshatriya,  Vaishya, Shudra, and Samanya. Each of these
five castes, O Great Queen!  have two stages of life. Listen, then, Adye! whilst I narrate to Thee  their mode of
life, rites, and duties (4−6). I have already spoken to  Thee of the incapacity of men born in the Kali Age.
Unused as they are  to penance, and devoid of learning in the Vedas, short−lived, and  incapable of strenuous
effort, how can they endure bodily labour? (7).
O Beloved! there is in the Kali Age no Brahmacharya nor Vanaprastha.  There are two stages only, Grihastha
and Bhikshuka (8). O Auspicious  One! In the Kali Age the householder should in all his acts be guided  by the
rules of the Agamas. He will never attain success by other ways  (9). And, O Devi! at the stage of the
mendicant the carrying of the  staff is not permitted, since, O Thou of Divine Knowledge! both that  and other
practices are Vedic (10). In the Kali Age, O Gentle One! the  adoption of the life of an Avadhuta, according to
the Shaiva rites, is  in the Kali Age equivalent to the  entry into the life of a Sannyasin  (11). When the Kali
Age is in full sway, the Vipras and the other  castes have equal right to enter into both these stages of life (12)
The purificatory rites of all are to be according to the rules ordained  by Shiva, though the particular practices
of the Vipras and other  castes vary (13).
A man becomes a householder the moment he is born. It is by  Sangskara that he enters upon any of the other
stages of life. For this  reason, O Great Queen! One should first be a householder, following the  rules of that
mode of life (14). When, however, one is freed of worldly  desires by the knowledge of the Real, it is then that
one should  abandon all and seek refuge in the life of an ascetic (15). In  childhood one should acquire
knowledge; in youth, wealth and wife. The  wise man in middle age will devote himself to acts of religion,
and in  his old age he should retire from the world (16).
No one should retire from the world who has an old father or mother,  a devoted and chaste wife, or young
and helpless children (17). He who  becomes an ascetic, leaving mothers, fathers, infant children, wives,
agnates and cognates, is guilty of a great sin (18). He who becomes a  mendicant without first satisfying the
need of his own parents and  relatives is guilty of the sins of killing his father and mother, a  woman, and a
Brahmana (19). The Brahmanas and men of other castes  should perform their respective purificatory rites
according to the  ordinances laid down by Shiva. This is the rule in the Kali Age (20).
Shri Devi said:
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 8  − The Dharmma and Customs  of the Castes and Ashramas
104

O Omnipresent One! tell Me what is the rule of life for the  householder and mendicant, and what are the
purificatory rites for the  Vipras and other castes (21).
Shri Sadashiva said:
The state of an householder is for all the descendants of Manu the  first duty. I shall, therefore, first speak of
it, and do Thou listen  to Me, O Lady of the Kaulas (22). A householder should be devoted to  the
contemplation of Brahman and possessed of the knowledge of Brahman,  and should consign whatever he
does to Brahman (23). He should not tell  an untruth, or practise deceit, and should ever be engaged in the
worship of the Devatas and guests (24). Regarding his father and mother  as two visible incarnate deities, he
should ever and by every means in  his power serve them (25). O Shiva! O Parvati! if the mother and father
are pleased, Thou too art pleased. and the Supreme Being is propitious  to him (26). O Primeval One! Thou art
the Mother of the Worlds, and the  Supreme Brahman is the Father; what better religious act can there be  than
that which pleases You both? (27). According to their  requirements, one should offer seats, beds, clothes,
drink, and food to  mother and father. They should always be spoken to in a gentle voice,  and their children's
demeanour should ever be agreeable to them. The  good son who ever obeys the behests of his mother and
father hallows  the family (28−29). If one desires one's own welfare, all arrogance,  mockery, threats, and
angry words should be avoided in the parents'  presence (30). The son who is obedient to his parents should,
out of  reverence to them, bow to them and stand up when he sees them, and  should not take his seat without
their permission (31). He who,  intoxicated with the pride of learning or wealth, slights his parents,  is beyond
the pale of all Dharmma, and goes to a terrible Hell (32).  Even if the vital breath were to reach his throat, the
householder  should not eat without first feeding his mother, father, son, wife,  guest, and brother (33). The
man who, to the deprivation of his elders  and equals, fills his own belly is despised in this world, and goes to
Hell in the next (34). The householder should cherish his wife, educate  his children, and support his kinsmen
and friends. This is the supreme  eternal duty (35). The body is nourished by the mother. It originates  from the
father. The kinsmen, out of love, teach. The man, therefore,  who forsakes them is indeed vile (36). For their
sake should an hundred  pains be undergone. With all one's ability they should be pleased. This  is the eternal
duty (37). That man who in this world turns his mind to  Brahman and adheres faithfully to the truth is above
all a man of good  deeds, and knows the Supreme, and is blest in all the worlds (38). The  householder should
never punish his wife, but should cherish her like a  mother. If she is virtuous and devoted to her husband, he
should never  forsake her even in times of greatest misfortune (39). The wise man,  whilst his own wife is
living, should never with wicked intent touch  another woman, otherwise he will go to hell (40). The wise
man should  not, when in a private place, live and sleep or lie down close to other  men's wives. He should
avoid all improper speech and braggart boldness  in their presence (41). By riches, clothes, love, respect, and
pleasing  words should one's wife be satisfied. The husband should never do  anything displeasing to her (42).
The wise man should not send his wife  to any festival, concourse of people, pilgrimage, or to another's  house,
except she be attended by his son or an inmate of his own house  (43).
O Maheshvari! that man whose wife is both faithful and happy is  surely looked upon as if he had performed
all Dharmma, and is truly Thy  favourite also (44). A father should fondle and nurture his sons until  their
fourth year, and then until their sixteenth they should be taught  learning and their duties (45). Up to their
twentieth year they should  be kept engaged in household duties, and thenceforward, considering  them as
equals, he should ever show affection towards them (46). In the  same manner a daughter should be cherished
and educated with great  care, and then given away with money and jewels to a wise husband (47).
The householder should thus also cherish and protect his brothers  and sisters and their children, his kinsmen,
friends, and servants  (48). He should also maintain his fellow−worshippers, fellow−villagers,  and guests,
whether ascetics or others (49). If the wealthy householder  does not so act, then let him be known as a beast,
a sinner, and one  despised in the worlds (50). The householder should not be inordinately  addicted to sleep,
idling, care for the body, dressing his hair, eating  or drinking, or attention to his clothes (51). He should be
moderate as  to food, sleep, speech, and sexual intercourse, and be sincere, humble,  pure, free from sloth, and
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 8  − The Dharmma and Customs  of the Castes and Ashramas
105

persevering (52). Chivalrous to his foes,  modest before his friends, relatives, and elders, he should neither
respect those who deserve censure nor slight those who are worthy of  respect (53). Men should only be
admitted to his trust and confidence  after association with them and observation of their nature,  inclination,
conduct, and friendly character (54). Even an  insignificant enemy should be feared, and one's own power
should be  disclosed only at the proper time. But on no account should one deviate  from the path of duty (55).
A religious man should not speak of his own  fame and prowess, of what has been told him in secret, nor of
the good  that he has done for others (56). A man of good name should not engage  in any quarrel with an
unworthy motive, nor when defeat is certain, nor  with those who are superior or inferior to himself He should
diligently  earn knowledge, wealth, fame, and religious merit, and avoid all  vicious habits, the company of the
wicked, falsehood, and treachery  (58). Ventures should be undertaken according to the circumstances and
one's condition in life, and actions should be done according to their  season. Therefore, in everything that a
man does he should first  consider whether the circumstances and time are suitable (59). The  householder
should employ himself in the acquisition of what is  necessary and in the protection of the same. He should be
judicious,  pious, good to his friends. He should be moderate in speech and  laughter, in particular in the
presence of those entitled to his  reverence (60). He should hold his senses under control, be of cheerful
disposition, think of what is good, be of firm resolve, attentive,  far−sighted, and discriminating in the use of
his senses (61).
The wise householder's speech should be truthful, mild, agreeable,  and salutary, yet pleasing, avoiding both
self−praise and the  disparagement of others (62). The man who has dedicated tanks, planted  trees, built
rest−houses on the roadside, or bridges, has conquered the  three worlds (63). That man who is the happiness
of his mother and  father, to whom his friends are devoted, and whose fame is sung by men,  he is the
conqueror of the three worlds (64). He whose aim is truth,  whose charity is ever for the poor, who has
mastered lust and anger, by  him are the three worlds conquered (65). He who covets not others'  wives or
goods, who is free of deceit and envy, by him the three worlds  are conquered (66). He who is not afraid in
battle nor to go to war  when there is need, and who dies in battle undertaken for a sacred  cause, by him the
three worlds are conquered (67). He whose soul is  free from doubts, who is devoted to and a faithful follower
of the  ordinances of Shiva, and remains under My control, by him the three  worlds are conquered (68). The
wise man who in his conduct with his  fellow−men looks with an equal eye upon friend and foe, by him are
the  three worlds conquered (69). O Devi! purity is of two kinds, external  and internal. The dedication of
oneself to Brahman is known as internal  purity (70), and the cleansing of the impurities of the body by water
or ashes, or any other matter which cleanses the body, is called  external purity (71).
O Dearest One! the waters of Ganga, or of any other river, tank,  pond, well, or pool, or of the celestial Ganga,
are equally purifying  (72). O Thou of auspicious Vows! the ashes from a place of sacrifice  and cleansed earth
are excellent, and the skin of an antelope and grass  are as purifying as earth (73). O Auspicious One! what
need is there to  say more about purity and impurity? Whatever purifies the mind that the  householder may do
(74). Let there be external purification upon  awakening from sleep, after sexual intercourse, making water,
voiding  the bowels, and at the close of a meal, and whenever dirt of any kind  has been touched (75).
Sandhya, whether Vaidika or Tantrika should be performed thrice  daily, and according as the worship
changes so does its service (76).  The worshippers of the Brahma−Mantra have performed their Sandhya when
they have made japa of the Gayatri, realizing within themselves the  identity of the Gayatri and Brahman (77).
In the case of those who are  not Brahma−worshippers, Vaidika Sandhya consists of the worship of and
offering of oblations to the Sun and the recitation of the Gayatri (78).
O Gentle One! In all daily prayers recitation shouldbe done one  thousand and eight or a hundred and eight or
ten times (79). O Devi!  the Shudras and Samanyas may observe any of the rites proclaimed by the  Agamas,
and by these they attain that which they desire (80). The three  times of performance (of Sandhya) are at
sunrise, at noon, and at  sunset (81).

Shri Devi said:
Thou hast Thyself said, O Lord! that when the Kali Age is in full  sway for all castes, commencing with the
Brahmamas, Tantrika rites are  alone appropriate. Why, then, dost Thou restrict the Vipras to Vedic  rites? It
behoveth Thee to explain this fully to Me (82−83).
Shri Sadashiva said:
O Thou Who knowest the essence of all things, truly hast Thou  spoken. In the Kali Age all observances bear
the fruit of enjoyment and  liberation when done according to the rites of the Tantras (84). The
Brahma−Savitri, though known as Vaidika, should be called Tantrika  also, and is appropriate in both
observances (85). It is, therefore, O  Devi! that I have said that when the Kali Age is in full sway, the
twice−born shall alone be entitled to the Gayatri, but not the other  Mantras (86). In the Kali Age the Savitri
should be said by the  Brahmanas, preceded by the Tara, and by the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas,  preceded by the
Kamala and Vagbhava Vijas respectively (87). In order,  O Supreme Devi! That a distinction may be drawn
between the twice−born  and the Shudras, the daily duties are directed to be preceded by  Vaidika Sandhya
(88). Success, however, may also be attained by the  mere following of the ordinances of Shambhu. This is
verily true, and I  repeat it is true and very true, and there is no doubt about it (89). O  Adored of the Devas!
even if the stated time for the saying of the  daily prayer is past, all who desire emancipation and are not
prevented  by sickness or weakness should say, "Ong the Ever−existent Brahman"  (90). The seat, clothes,
vessels, bed, carriages, residence, and  household furniture of the worshipper should be as clean as possible
(91). At the close of the daily prayers the householder should keep  himself occupied with household duties or
the study of the Vedas; he  should never remain idle (92). In holy places, on holy days, or when  the Sun or
Moon is in eclipse, he should do inward recitation, and give  alms, and thus become the abode of all that is
good (93).
In the Kali Age life is dependent on the food that is eaten, fasting  is therefore not recommended, in lieu of it,
the giving of alms is  ordained (94). O Great Queen! in the Kali Age alms are efficacious in  the
accomplishment of all things. The proper objects of such alms are  the poor devoted to meritorious acts (95).
O Mother! the first days of  the month, of the year, of the lunar half−months, the fourteenth day of  the lunar
half−month, the eighth day of the light half of the lunar  month, the eleventh day of the lunar half−month, the
new moon, one's  birthday, the anniversary of one's father's death, and days fixed as  those of festivals, are
holy days (96−97).
The River Ganges and all the great Rivers, the house of the  religious Teacher, and the places of the Devas are
holy places. But for  those who, neglecting the study of the Veda, the service of mother and  father, and the
protection of their wife, go to places of pilgrimage,  such holy places are changed to hell (98−99). For women
there is no  necessity to go on pilgrimage, to fast, or to do other like acts, nor  is there any need to perform any
devotion except that which consists in  the service of their husband (100). For a woman her husband is a place
of pilgrimage, the performance of penance, the giving of alms, the  carrying out of vows, and her spiritual
teacher. Therefore should a  woman devote herself to the service of her husband with her whole self  (101).
She should ever by words and deeds of devotion act for the  pleasure of her husband, and, remaining faithful
to his behests, should  please his relations and friends (102).
A woman whose husband is her vow should not look at him with hard  eyes, or utter hard words before him.
Not even in her thought should  she do anything which is displeasing to her husband (103). She who by  body,
mind, and word, and by pleasant acts, ever pleases her husband,  attains to the abode of Brahman (104).
Remaining ever faithful to the  wishes of her husband, she should not look upon the face of other men,  or have
converse with them, or uncover her body before them (105).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 8  − The Dharmma and Customs  of the Castes and Ashramas

In childhood she should remain under the control of her parents, in  her youth of her husband, and in her old
age of the friends and  relatives of her husband. She should never be independent (106).
A father should not marry his daughter if she does not know her duty  to a husband and how to serve him, also
the other rules of woman's  conduct (107).
Neither the flesh of human beings, nor the animals resembling them,  nor the flesh of the cow, which is
serviceable in various ways, nor the  flesh of carnivorous animals, nor such meat as is tasteless, should be
eaten (108). Auspicious One! fruits and roots of various kinds whether  grown in villages or jungles, and all
that is grown in the ground, may  be eaten at pleasure (109).
Teaching and the performance of sacrifices are the proper duties of  a Brahmana. But if he be incapable of
these, he may earn his livelihood  by following the profession of a Kshatriya or Vaishya (110). The proper
occupation of a Rajanya is that of fighting and ruling. But if he be  incapable of these, he may earn his
livelihood by following the  profession of a Vaishya or Shudra (111). If a Vaishya cannot trade,  then for him
the following of the profession of a Shudra involves no  blame. For a Shudra, O Sovereign Queen! service is
the prescribed means  of livelihood (112). O Devi! members of the Samanya class may for their  maintenance
follow all occupations except such as are specially  reserved for the Brahmana (113). The latter, void of hate
and  attachment, self−controlled, truthful, the conqueror of his senses,  free of envy and all guile, should
pursue his own avocations (114). He  should ever be the same to, and the well−wisher of, all men, and teach
his well−behaved pupils as if they were his own sons (115). He should  ever avoid falsehood, detraction, and
vicious habits, arrogance,  friendship for low persons, the pursuit of low objects, and the use of  language
which gives offence (116). Where peace is possible, avoid war.  Peace with honour is excellent. O Adorable
Face! for the Rajanya it  should be either death or victory in battle (117). A man of the kingly  caste should not
covet the wealth of his subjects, or levy excessive  taxes, but, being faithful to his promises, he should ever in
the  observance of his duty protect his subjects as though they were his own  children (118). In government,
war, treaties, and other affairs of  State the King should take the advice of his Ministers (119). War  should be
carried on in accordance with Dharmma. Rewards and  punishments should be awarded justly and in
accordance with the  Shastras. The best treaty should be concluded which his power allows  (120). By
stratagem should the end desired be attained. By the same  means should wars be conducted and treaties
concluded. Victory, peace,  and prosperity follow stratagem (121). He should ever avoid the company  of the
low, and be good to the learned. He should be of a calm  disposition judicious of action in time of trouble, of
good conduct and  reasonable in his expenditure (122).
He should be an expert in the maintenance of his forts, well trained  in the use of arms. He should ever
ascertain the disposition of his  army, and teach his soldiers military tactics (123). O Devi1 he should  not in
battle kill one who is stunned, who has surrendered his arms, or  is a fugitive, nor those of his enemies whom
he has capturedn nor their  wives or children (124). Whatever is acquired either by victory or  treaty should be
distributed amongst the soldiers in shares according  to merit (125).
The King should make known to himself the character and courage of  each of his warriors, and if he would
care for his interests he should  not place a large army under the command of a single officer (126). He  should
not put his trust in any single person, nor place one man in  charge of the administration, nor treat his inferiors
as equals, nor be  familiar with them (127). He should be very learned, yet not garrulous;  full of knowledge,
yet anxious to learn; full of honours, yet without  arrogance. In awarding both reward and punishment he
should be  discriminating (128). The King should either himself or through his  spies watch his subjects,
kinsmen, and servants (129). A wise master  should not either honour or degrade anyone in a fit of passion or
arrogance and without due cause (130). Soldiers, commanders, ministers,  wife, children, and servitors he
should protect. If guilty, they should  be punished according to their deserts (131). The King should protect,
like a father, the insane, incapable, children and orphans, and those  who are old and infirm (132). Know that
agriculture and trade are the  appropriate callings of the Vaishya. It is by agriculture and trade  that man's body
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 8  − The Dharmma and Customs  of the Castes and Ashramas
108

is maintained (133). Therefore, O Devi! in agriculture  and trade all negligence, vicious habits, laziness,
untruth, and deceit  should be avoided with the whole soul (134). Shiva! when both buyer and  seller are
agreed as to the object of sale and the price thereof, and  mutual promises have been made, then the purchase
becomes complete  (135). O Dearest One! the sale or gift of property by one who is a  lunatic, out of his
senses, under age, a captive, or enfeebled by  disease, is invalid (136). The purchase of things not seen is
concluded  by hearing the description thereof. If the article be found to differ  from its description, then the
purchase is set aside (137). The sale of  an elephant, a camel, and a horse is effected by the description of the
animal. The sale is, however, set aside if the animal does not answer  its description (138). If in the purchase
of elephants, camels, and  horses a latent vice becomes patent within the course of a year from  the date of sale,
then the purchase is set aside, but not after the  lapse of one year (139). O Devi of the Kulas! the human body
is the  receptacle of piety, wealth, desires, and final liberation. It should  therefore never be the subject of
purchase; and such a purchase is by  reason of My commands invalid (140).
O Dear One! in the borrowing of barley, wheat, or paddy, the profit  of the lender at the end of the year is laid
down to be a fourth of the  quantity lent, and in the case of the loan of metals one−eighth (141).  In monetary
transactions, agriculture, trade, and in all other  transactions, men should ever carry out their undertakings.
This is  approved by the laws (142). A servant should be skilful, clean,  wakeful, careful and alert, and possess
his senses under control (143).  He should, as he desires happiness in this and the next world, regard  his
master as if he were Vishnu Himself, his master's wife; his own  mother, and respect his master's kinsmen and
friends (144). He should  know his master's friends to be his friends, and his master's enemies  to be his
enemies and should ever remain in respectful attendance upon  his master, awaiting his orders (145). He
should carefully conceal his  master's dishonour, the family dissensions, anything said in private or  which
would disgrace his master (146). He should not covet the wealth  of his master, but remain ever devoted to his
good. He should not make  use of bad words or laugh or play in his masters presence (147). He  should not,
with lustful mind, even look at the maidservants in his  master's house, or lie down with them, or play with
them in secret  (148). He should not use his master's bed, seat, carriages, clothes,  vessels, shoes, jewels, or
weapons (149). If guilty, he should beg the  forgiveness of his master. He should not be forward, impertinent,
or  attempt to place himself on an equal footing with his master (150).
Except when in the Bhairavi−chakra or Tattva−chakra persons of all  castes should marry in their caste
according to the Brahma form, and  should eat with their own caste people (151). O Great Queen! in these  two
circles, however, marriage in the Shaiva form is ordained, and as  regards eating and drinking, no caste
distinctions exist (152).
Shri Devi said:
What is the Bhairavi−chakra, and what is the Tattva−chakra? I desire  to hear, and it kindly behoves Thee to
speak of them (153).
Shri Sadashiva said:
O Devi! in the ordinances relating to Kula worship I have spoken of  the formation of circles by the excellent
worshippers at times of  special worship (154). O Dear One! there is no rule relating to the  Bhairavi−chakra.
This auspicious circle may at any time be formed  (155). I will now speak of the rites relating to this circle,
which  benefits the worshippers, and in which, if the Devi be worshipped, She  speedily grants the prayers of
Her votaries (156).
The Kulacharyya should spread an excellent mat in a beautiful place,  and, after purifying it with the Kama
and Astra Vijas, should seat  himself upon it (157). Then the wise one should draw a square with a  triangle in
it with either vermilion or red sandal wood paste, or  simply water (158). Then, taking a painted jar, and
smearing it with  curd and sun−dried rice, and placing a vermilion mark on it, let him  put a branch or leaves
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 8  − The Dharmma and Customs  of the Castes and Ashramas
109

and fruit upon it (159). Filling it with  perfumed water whilst uttering the Pranava, the worshipper should
place  it on the Mandala, and exhibit before it lights and incense−sticks  (160). The jar should then be
worshipped with two fragrant flowers.  Ishta−devata should be meditated upon as being in the jar. The ritual
should be according to the shortened form (161). Listen, O Adored of  the Immortals! whilst I speak to Thee
of the peculiar features of this  worship. There is no necessity of placing the wine−cups for the Guru  and
others 162). The worshipper should then take such of the elements  of worship as he wishes, and place them in
front of himself. Then,  purifying them with the Weapon Mantra, let him gaze upon them with  steadfast eyes
(163).
Then, placing scent and flowers in the wine−jar, let him meditate  upon the Ananda−Bhairava and
Ananda−Bhairavi in it (164).
Dhyana
He should meditate upon the Blissful Devi as in first bloom of  youth, with a body rosy as the first gleam of
the rising Sun. The sweet  nectar of Her smiles illumines Her face as beautiful as a full−blown  lotus. Decked
with jewels, clad in beauteous coloured raiment  delighting in dance and song, She with the lotus of her hands
makes the  signs which confer blessings and dispel fears (165−166).
After thus meditating on Blissful Devi, let the worshipper thus  meditate upon the Blissful Bhairava (167).
Dhyana
I meditate upon the Deva Who is white as camphor, Whose eyes are  large and beautiful like lotuses, the lustre
of Whose body is adorned  with celestial raiments and jewels, Who holds in His left hand the cup  of nectar,
and in the right a ball of Shuddhi (168).
Having thus meditated upon Them both, and thinking of them in a  state of union in the wine−jar, the
worshipper should then worship Them  therein. With Mantra, beginning with the Pranava and ending with
Namah,  the names of the Devata being placed between, and with perfume and  flower, let him then sanctify
the wine (169)
The Kula worshipper should sanctify the wine by repeating over it  the Pashadi−trika−vija a hundred and eight
times (170). When the Kali  Age is in full sway, in the case of the householder whose mind is  entirely
engrossed with domestic desires, the three sweets should be  substituted in the place of the first element of
worship (wine) (171).  Milk, sugar, and honey are the three sweets. They should be deemed to  be the image of
wine, and as such offered to the Deity (172). Those  born in the Kali Age are by their nature weak in intellect,
and their  minds are distracted by lust. By reason of this they do not recognize  the Shakti to be the image of
the Deity (173). Therefore, O Parvati!  for such as these let there be, in place of the last element of worship
(sexual union), meditation upon the lotus−feet of the Devi and the  inward recitation of their Ishta−mantra
(174).
Therefore such of the elements of worship as have been obtained  should be consecrated by the recitation over
each of them of the same  Mantra one hundred times (175). Let the worshipper, with closed eyes,  meditate
upon them as suffused by Brahman, then offer them to Kali,  and, lastly, eat and drink the consecrated
elements (176). O Gentle  One! this is the Bhairavi−chakra, which is not revealed in the other  Tantras. I have,
however spoken before Thee of it. It is the essence of  essences, and more excellent than the best (177).
Parvati! In  Bhairavi−chakra and Tattva−chakra the excellent worshipper should be  wedded to his Shakti,
according to the laws prescribed by Shiva (178).  The Vira who without marriage worships by enjoyment of
Shakti is,  without doubt, guilty of the sin of going with another man's wife  (179). When the Bhairavi−chakra
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Dhyana
110

has been formed, the members thereof  are like the best of the twice−born; but when the circle is broken,  they
revert again to their own respective castes (180). In this circle  there is no distinction of caste nor impurity of
food. The heroic  worshippers in the circle are My image; there is no doubt of that  (181). In the formation of
the circle there is no rule as to time or  place or question as to fitness. The necessary articles may be used by
whomsoever they may have been brought (182). Food brought from a long  distance, whether it be cooked or
uncooked, whether brought by a Vira  or a Pashu, becomes pure immediately it is brought within the circle
(183).
While the circle is being formed, all dangers flee in confusion,  awed by the Brahmanic lustre of its heroes
(184). Upon the mere hearing  that a Bhairavi circle has been formed at any place, fierce Pishachas,
Guhyakas, Yakshas, and Vetalas depart afar off in fear (185). Into the  circle come all the holy places, the
great and holy places, and with  reverence Indra and all the Immortals (186). Shiva! the place where a  circle is
formed is a great and holy place, more sacred than each and  all the other holy places. Even the Thirty desire
the excellent  offerings made to Thee in this circle (187). Whatever the food be,  whether cooked or uncooked,
and whether brought by a Mlechchha,  Chandala, Kirata, or Huna, it becomes pure as soon as it is placed in
the hand of a Vira (188). By the seeing of the circle and of the  worshippers therein, who are but images of
Myself, men infected with  the taint of the Kali Age are liberated from the bonds of the life of a  Pashu (189).
When, however the Kali Age is in full sway, the circle  should not be concealed. The Vira should at all places
and at all times  practise Kula rites and make Kula worship (190).
In the circle all distinction of caste, frivolous talk, levity,  garrulity, spitting, and breaking wind should be
avoided (191). Such as  are cruel, mischievous, Pashu, sinful, atheists, blasphemers of Kula  doctrine, and
calumniators of the Kula Scriptures, should not be  allowed into the circle (192). Even the Vira who, induced
by affection,  fear, or attachment, admits a Pashu into the circle falls from his Kula  duty, and goes to hell
(193). All who have sought refuge in the Kula  Dharmma, whether Brahmamas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas,
Shudras, or Samanyas,  should ever be worshipped like Devas (194). He who, whilst in the  circle, makes,
from pride, distinctions of caste, descends to a  terrible hell, even though he should have gone to the very end
of the  Vedanta (195). How within the circle can there be any fear of sin for  Kaulas, who are good and pure of
heart and who are manifestly the very  image of Shiva? (196). Vipras and others who are followers of Shiva
should, so long as they are within the circle, follow the ordinance of  Shiva and the observances prescribed by
Him (197).
Without the circle each should follow his own calling according to  his caste and stage of life, and should
discharge his duty as a man of  the world (198). One Japa made by a devout man, when seated within the
circle, bears the fruit attainable by the performance of a hundred  Purashcharana and by Shavasana,
Mundasana, and Chitasana (199). Who can  describe the glory of the Bhairavi−chakra? Its formation, though
but  once only, frees of all sins (200). The man who for six months worships  in such a circle will become a
King: he who so worships for a year  becomes the conqueror of death, and by the daily performance of such
worship he attains to Nirvvana (201).
What is the need, O Kalika! of saying more? Know this for certain:  that for the attainment of happiness in this
or the next world there is  only the Kula−dharmma, and no other (202). When the Kali Age is  dominant and
all religion is abandoned, even a Kaula merits hell by  concealment of the Kula−dharmma (203).
I have spoken of the Bhairavi circle, which is the sole means of  attaining enjoyment and final liberation. I
will now speak to Thee, O  Queen of the Kaulas! of the Tattva circle. Do Thou listen (204).
The Tattva circle is the king of all circles. It is also called the  celestial circle. Only worshippers who have
attained to a knowledge of  Brahman may take part in it (205). Only those servants of the Brahman  may take
part in this circle who have attained to knowledge of Brahman,  who are devoted to Brahman, pure of heart,
tranquil, devoted to the  good of all things, who are unaffected by the external world, who see  no differences,
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Dhyana
111

but to whom all things are the same, who are merciful,  faithful to their vows, and who have realized the
Brahman (206−207).
O Knower of the Supreme Soul! only those who, possessing the  knowledge of the Real, look upon this
moving and motionless Existence  as one with Brahman, such men are privileged to take part in this  circle
(208). They who regard everything in the Tattva circle as  Brahman, they alone, O Devi, are qualified to take
part therein (209).  In the formation of this circle there is no necessity for placing the  wine−jar, no lengthy
ritual. It can be formed everywhere in a spirit of  devotion to Brahman (210). O Dearest One! the worshipper
of the  Brahma−Mantra and a devout believer in Brahman should be the Lord of  the circle, which he should
form of other worshippers who know the  Brahman (211). In a beautiful and clean place, pleasant to the
worshippers, pure seats should be spread with beautiful carpets (212).  There, O Shiva! the Lord of the circle
should seat himself with the  worshippers of Brahman, and have the elements of worship brought and  placed
in front of him (213). The Lord of the Circle should inwardly  recite the Mantra, beginning with the Tara and
ending with the  Prana−vija, a hundred times, and then pronounce the following Mantra  over the elements
(214):
Mantra
The act of offering is Brahman. The offering itself is Brahman. The  Fire is Brahman. He by whom the
offering is made is Brahman. By him who  is absorbed in the worship of Brahman is unity with Brahman
attained  (215).
All the elements should be purified by the inward recitation of this  Mantra seven or three times (216). Then,
with the Brahma−Mantra, making  an offering of the food and drink to the Supreme Soul, he should  partake
thereof with the other worshippers, knowers of the Brahman  (217). O Great Queen! there is no distinction of
caste in the Brahma  circle, nor rule as to place or time or cup. The ignorant who, through  want of care, make
distinctions of birth or caste go upon the downward  path (218−219). And therefore should those excellent
worshippers,  possessed of the knowledge that the Supreme Brahman pervades all  things, perform the rites of
the Tattva circle with every care for the  attainment of religious merit, fulfilment of desire, wealth, and
liberation (220).
Shri Devi said:
Lord! Thou hast spoken in full of the duties of the householder; it  now behoves Thee kindly to speak of the
duties appropriate to the  ascetic life (221).
Shri Sadashiva said:
Devi! the stage of life of an Avadhuta is in the Kali Age called  Sannyasa. Now listen while I tell thee what
should be done (222).
When an adept in spiritual wisdom has acquired the knowledge of  Brahman, and has ceased to care for the
things of the world, he should  seek refuge in the life of an ascetic (223). If, however, in order to  adopt the life
of a wandering mendicant, one abandons an old mother or  father, infant children and a devoted wife, or
helpless dependents, one  goes to hell (224). All, whether Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra,  or Samanya
are equally entitled to take part in the purificatory  ceremony of the Kula ascetic (225).
After the performance of all the duties of a householder, and after  satisfying all dependents, one should go
forth from his house  indifferent, free from desires, with all his senses conquered (226). He  who wishes thus to
leave his house should call together his kinsmen and  friends, his neighbours and men of his village, and
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
112

lovingly ask of  them their permission (227). Having obtained it, and made obeisance to  his Ishta−devata, he
should go round his village, and then without  attachment set forth from his house (228). Liberated from the
bonds of  household life, and immersed in exceeding joy, he should approach a  Kula ascetic of divine
knowledge and pray to him as follows: (229)
"0 Supreme Brahman! all this life of mine has been spent in the  discharge of household duties. Do Thou O
Lord! be gracious to me in  this my adoption of the life of an ascetic" (230).
The religious Preceptor should thereupon satisfy himself that the  disciple's duties as a householder have all
been accomplished, and, on  finding him to be meek and full of discernment, initiate him into the  second stage
(231). The disciple should then, with a well−controlled  mind, make his ablutions and say his daily prayer,
and then, with the  object of being absolved from the threefold debt due to them, worship  the Devas, the
Rishis, and the Pitris (232).
By the Devas are meant Brahma, Vishnu, and Rudra, with their  followers; by the Rishis are meant Sanaka
and others, as also the  Devarshis and the Brahmarshis (233). Listen, whilst I now enumerate the  ancestors
which should be worshipped (234). The father, paternal  grandfather, paternal great−grandfather, mother, the
maternal  grandfather, and others in the ascending line, and the maternal  grandmother and others in the
ascending line (235). Upon the dedication  of oneself to the life of an ascetic, the Devas and Rishis should be
worshipped in the East, the paternal ancestors in the South, the  maternal ancestors in the West (236).
Spreading two seats on each of  these sides, beginning from the East, and invoking the Devas and others
thereto, they should there be worshipped (237). Having worshipped them  in proper form, pindas should be
offered to each of them separately  according to the rules relating thereto; And then, with folded palms,  let the
disciple thus supplicate the Devas and Ancestors (238):
Mantra
O Fathers! O Mothers! O Devas! O Rishis! be you satisfied. Do you  absolve me, about to enter upon the path
of renunciation from all debts  (239).
Having thus prayed to be free from all debts, bowing again and  again, and being thus freed of all debts, he
should perform his own  funeral rites (240). The father and paternal grandfather and  great−grandfather are one
soul. In offering, therefore, the individual  soul to the Supreme Soul, he who is wise should perform his own
funeral  rites (241). O Devi! sitting with his face to the North, and invoking  the spirits of his ancestors upon
the seats which he has prepared for  them, he should, after doing them homage, offer the funeral cakes  (242).
In so offering he should spread kusha grass with its end towards  the East, South, West, and towards the North
for himself (243). After  completion, according to the directions of the Guru, of the funeral  rites, the seeker
after emancipation should, in order to purify his  heart inwardly, recite the following Mantra a hundred times
(244):
Mantra
Hring, let us worship the Three−eyed One whose fame is fragrant, the  Augmenter of increase. May I, as the
urvaruka is freed of its stalk, be  liberated from death unto immortality (245).
Then the religious Preceptor should draw a figure on the altar of a  shape in accordance with the divinity about
to be worshipped and then  place the jar on the altar and commence worship (246). Then the Guru,  possessed
of divine knowledge, should meditate upon the Supreme Spirit  in the manner prescribed by Shambhu, and
after worship place fire on  the altar (247). The Guru should then offer unto the fire so sanctified  the oblation
according to the Sangkalpa, and then make his disciple  perform the complete homa (248). He should first
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
113

offer oblation with  the Vyahritis, and then with the vital airs, prana, apana, samana,  udana, vyana (249).
For the destruction of the false belief that the body, whether gross  or subtle, is the Atma, the Tattva−Homa
should be performed, uttering  the following words:
Mantra
Earth, water, fire, air, ether, (then) scent, taste, vision, touch,  sound, (then) speech, hands, feet, anus and
organ of generation, (then)  ears, skin, eyes, tongue, and smell, (then) manas, buddhi, ahangkara,  and chitta,
(and lastly) all the functions of the senses and of life  (250−253).
He should then say:
"May they be purified;" (adding) "May I be like unto the universal  Chaitanya united with Hring. May I be
like the Light beyond and above  Rajo−guna, and may I be free of the taint of ignorance" (254).
Having consigned as oblations into the fire the twenty−four tattvas  and the functions of the body, he who is
now devoid of all action  should consider his body as dead (255). Considering his body as dead  and devoid of
all function, and calling to mind the Supreme Brahman,  let him take off his sacred thread (256). He, the
possessor of divine  knowledge, should take it from his shoulder, uttering the
Mantra
Aing Kling Hangsa.
Holding it in his hand while he recites the three Vyahritis, ending  with Svaha, let him throw it steeped in ghee
into the fire (257).  Having thus offered the sacred thread as an oblation to the fire, he  should, whilst uttering
the Kama Vija, cut off his crown−lock and take  and place it in the ghee (258).
Mantra
O Crown Lock! Daughter of Brahman! thou art an ascetic in the form  of hair. I am now placing thee in the
Purifying One. Depart, O Devi! I  make obeisance to thee (259).
He should then, whilst uttering the Kama, Maya, Kurcha, and Astra  Vijas, ending with the word Svaha, make
the Homa sacrifice of that lock  of hair in the well−sanctified fire (260). The Pitris, Devas, and  Devarshis, as
also all acts performed in the stages of life, reside in  that lock and have it as their support (261).
Therefore the man who renounces the crown−lock and sacred thread  after the performance of the oblation
becomes one with Brahman (262).  The twice−born enter the stage of an ascetic by renunciation of the
crown−lock and sacred thread, and the Shudras and Samanyas by the  renunciation of the crown−lock only
(263). Then he whose crown−lock and  sacred thread have been thus removed should make obeisance to the
Guru,  laying himself full length upon the ground. The Guru should then raise  his disciple and say into his
right ear: "0 wise one! thou art That."  "Think within thyself that I am He and He is I. Free from all
attachments and sense of self, do thou go as thou pleasest as moved  thereto by thy nature" (264−265). The
Guru, full of the knowledge of  the Divine essence, should then, after removal of the jar and the fire,  bow to
the disciple, recognizing in him his own very self (266), and  say: "O Thou whose form is this Universe! I
bow to Thee and to myself.  Thou art ÔThat' and ÔThat' is Thou. Again I bow to thee." (267).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
114

The worshippers of the Brahma−Mantra, possessed of divine knowledge,  who have conquered themselves,
attain the stage of an ascetic by  cutting off the crown−lock with their own Mantra (268). What need is  there
for those purified by divine knowledge of sacrificial or funeral  rites or ritual worship? For they, acting as they
please, are never  guilty of any fault (269). The disciple, image of the absence of all  contraries, desireless, and
of tranquil mind, may, as he pleases, roam  the earth, the visible image of Brahman (270). He will think of
everything, from Brahma to a blade of grass, as the image of the  existent one, and, oblivious of his own name
and form, he will meditate  upon the Supreme Soul in himself (271). Homeless, merciful, fearless,  devoid of
attachment claiming nothing as his own, devoid of egoism, the  ascetic will move about the earth (272). He is
free of all  prohibitions. He shall not strive to attain what he has not, nor to  protect what he has. He knows
himself. He is equally unaffected by  either joy or sorrow. He is calm, the conqueror of himself, and free  from
all desires (273).
His soul is untroubled even in sorrow, desireless even in  prosperity. He is ever joyful, pure, calm, indifferent
and unperturbed.  He will hurt no living thing, but will be ever devoted to the good of  all being. He is free
from anger and fear, with his senses under  contro1 and without desire. He strives not for the preservation of
his  body. He is not obsessed by any longing (274−275). He will be free from  grief and resentment, equal to
friend and foe, patient in the endurance  of cold and heat, and to him both honour and disgrace are one and the
same (276). He is the same in good or evil fortune, pleased with  whatsoever, without effort, he may obtain.
He is beyond the three  attributes, of unconditioned mind free of covetousness, and (wealth) he  will hoard not
(277). He will be happy in the knowledge that, as the  unreal universe exists dependent upon the Truth, so
does the body  depend upon the soul (278). He attains liberation by the realization  that the soul is completely
detached from the organs of sense, and is  the witness of that which is done (279).
The ascetic should not accept any metal, and should avoid calumny,  untruth, jealousy, all play with woman,
and all discharge of seed  (280). He should regard with an equal eye worms, men, and Devas. The  religious
mendicant should know that in everything he does, in that is  Brahman (281). He should eat without making
any distinction of place,  time, person, or vessel, and whether from the hand of a Vipra or  Chandala, or from
any other person whatsoever (282). The ascetic,  thouugh passing his time as he pleases, should study the
Scriptures  relating to the Soul and in meditation upon the nature of That (283).  The corpse of an ascetic
should on no account be cremated. It should be  worshipped with scents and flowers, and then either buried or
sunk into  water (284). O Devi! the inclination of those men who have not attained  union with the Supreme
Soul and who ever seek after enjoyment, is by  nature turned towards the path of action  (285).
They remain attached to the practice of meditation, ritual worship,  and recitation. Let them who are strong in
their faith therein know  that to be the best for them (286). It is on account of them that I  have spoken of
various rites for the purification of the heart, and  have with the same object devised many names and forms
(287). O Devi!  without knowledge of the Brahman and the abandonment of all ritual  worship, man cannot
attain emancipation even though he performed  countless such acts of worship (288). The householder should
consider  the Kula ascetic, possessed of divine knowledge, to be the visible  Narayana in the form of man, and
should worship Him as such (289). By  the mere sight of one who has subdued his passions a man is freed of
all his sins, and earns that merit which he obtains by journeying to  places of pilgrimage, the giving of alms,
and the performance of all  vows, penances, and sacrifices (290)

Chapter 9  − The Ten Kinds of  Purificatory Rites (Sangskara)
THE Adorable Sadashiva said:
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 9  − The Ten Kinds of  Purificatory Rites (Sangskara)
115

O Virtuous One! I have spoken to Thee of the custom and religious  duties appropriate to the different castes
and stages of life. Do thou  now listen whilst I tell Thee of the purificatory rites of the  different castes (1).
Without such rites, O Devi! the body is not  purified, and he who is not purified may not perform the
ceremonies  relating to the Devas and the Pitris (2). Therefore it is that men of  every caste, commencing with
the Vipras, who desire their welfare in  this life and hereafter, should, in all things and with care, perform  the
purificatory rites which have been ordained for their respective  castes (3).
The ten purificatory ceremonies are those relating to conception,  pregnancy, and birth of the child; the giving
of its name, its first  view of the sun, its first eating of rice, tonsure, investiture, and  marriage (4).
The Shudras and mixed castes have no sacred thread, and but nine  purificatory ceremonies; for the
twice−born classes there are ten (5).  O Beautiful Lady! all observances, whether they be obligatory,
occasional, or voluntary, should be performed according to the  injunctions of Shambhu (6). O Dearest One! I
have already, in My form  of Brahma, spoken of the rules appropriate to the purificatory and  other
observances (7), and of the Mantras appropriate to the various  purificatory and other observances, according
to the differences in  caste (8).
In the Satya, Treta, and Dvapara Ages, the Mantras, O Kalika! were  in their application preceded by the
Pranava (9); but in the Kali Age,  O Supreme Devi! the decree of Shangkara is that man do perform all  rites
with the aid of the same Mantras, but preceded by the Maya Vija  (10). All Mantras in the Nigamas, Agamas,
Tantras, Sanghitas and Vedas,  have been spoken by Me. Their employment, however, varies according to  the
Ages (11). For the benefit of men of the Kali Age, men bereft of  energy and dependent for existence on the
food they eat, the Kula  doctrine, O Auspicious One! is given (12).
I will now speak to Thee in brief of the purificatory and other  rites, suitable for the weak men of the Kali
Age, whose minds are  incapable of continued effort (13). Kushandika precedes all auspicious  ceremonies. I
shall, therefore, O Adored of the Devas! speak firstly of  it. Do Thou listen (14). In a clean and pleasant spot,
free from husks  and charcoal, let the wise one make a square, the sides of which are of  one cubit's length
(15). Then draw in it three lines from the West to  East (of the square). Let him then sprinkle water over them,
uttering  the Kurcha Vija the while. Then Fire should be brought to the  accompaniment of the Vahni Vija
(16). The Fire, when so brought, should  be placed by the side of the square, the worshipper breathing the
Vagbhava Vija (17). Then, taking up a piece of burning wood with the  right hand from the Fire, he should put
it aside as the share of the  Rakshasas, saying:
Mantra
Hring, Salutation to the raw−meat eaters: Svaha (18).
The worshipper, lifting up the consecrated Fire with both hands,  should place it in front of him on the three
lines (above mentioned),  inwardly reciting the while the Maya Vija before the Vyahritis (19).  Grass and
wood should then be thrown upon the Fire to make it blaze,  and two pieces of wood should be smeared with
ghee and offered as an  oblation to it. Thereafter Fire should be named according to the object  of worship, and
then meditated upon as follows (20):
Dhyana
Ruddily effulgent like the young Sun, with seven tongues and two  crowned heads of matted hair, seated on a
goat, whose weapon is Shakti.  (21)
Having so meditated upon the Carrier of oblations, He should be thus  invoked with joined palms (22).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
116

Mantra 
Hring, come, O Carrier of Oblations to all the Immortals, come! Come  with the Rishis and Thy followers, and
protect the sacrifice. I  make obeisance to Thee. Svaha (23).
Having thus invoked Him, the worshipper should say, "0 Fire! this is  Thy seat," and then worship him, the
Seven−tongued, with appropriate  offerings (24). The seven licking Tongues of Fire are: Kali, Karali,
Mano−java, Sulohita, Su−dhumra−varna, Sphulingini, and Vishva−nirupini  (25). Then, O Great Devi! the
sides of the Fire should be thrice  sprinkled with water from the hand, beginning from the East and ending  at
the North (26). Then the sides of the Fire, from the South to the  North, should be thrice sprinkled with water,
and following that the  articles of sacrifice should be thrice sprinkled (27). Then spread  kusha grass on the
sides of the square, beginning with the East and  ending with the North. The ends of the blades of grass on the
North  should be turned towards the North, and the rest of the grass should be  placed with its ends towards the
East (28). The worshipper should then  proceed to the seat placed for Brahma, keeping the Fire on his right,
and, picking up with his left thumb and little finger a blade of kusha  grass from the seat of Brahma, should
throw it along with the remaining  blades of kusha grass on the South side of the fire, uttering the
Mantra
"Hring, Destroy the abode of the enemy" (29−30).
(The performer of the sacrifice should then say to Brahma:) " O  Brahman, Lord of Sacrifices, be thou seated
here. This seat is made for  thee." The Brahma, saying "I sit," should then sit down, with his face  turned
towards the North (31). After worshipping Brahma with scent,  flowers, and the other articles of worship, let
him be supplicated thus  (32):
Mantra
O Lord of Sacrifices! protect the sacrifice.O Brihaspati! protect  this sacrifice. Protect me also, the performer
of this sacrifice.O  Witness of all acts! I bow to Thee (33).
Brahma should then say, "I protect," and if there is no person  representing Brahma, then the performer of the
sacrifice should, for  the success of the sacrifice, make an image with darbha grass of the  Vipra, and himself
say this (34). The worshipper should then invoke  Brahma, saying, "0 Brahman, come here, come here!" and,
after doing  honour to him by offering water for washing his feet and the like, let  him supplicate him, saying,
"So long as this sacrifice be not  concluded, do Thou deign to remain here," and then make obeisance to  him
(35). He should then sprinkle the space between the North−East  corner of the fire and the seat of Brahma
three times with water taken  in his hand, and should thereafter sprinkle the fire also three times,  and then,
returning the way he went, take his own seat. Let him then  spread on the North side of the square some
darbha grass, with the ends  of the blades towards the North (36−37). He should then place thereon  the articles
necessary for the sacrifice, such as the vessel (filled  with water) for sprinkling, and the vesse1 containing
ghee, sacrificial  fuel, and kusha grass. He should also place the sacrificial ladle and  spoon on the darbha
grass, and purify them by sprinkling water over  them, and then, regarding them with a celestial gaze, uttering
the
Mantra
Hrang Hring Hrung (38−39).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
117

Then, with his right knee touching the ground, let him put ghee into  the spoon with the ladle, and, with desire
for his own well−being, Jet  him offer three oblations, saying the
Mantra
Hring to Vishnu. Svaha (40).
Taking again ghee in the same way, and meditating upon Prajapati,  oblations should be offered with ghee
streaked across the fire from the  corner of Agni to that of Vayu (41). Taking ghee again and meditating  on
Indra, let him offer oblations from the corner of Nairrita to that  of Ishana (42). O Devi! oblations should
thereafter be offered to the  North, the South, and to the middle of the fire, to Agni, Soma, and to  Agni and
Soma together (43). Upon that three oblations should be  offered, uttering the
Mantras
Hring salutation to Agni,
Hring salutation to Soma,
Hring salutation to both Agni and Soma,
respectively. Having performed these (preliminary) rites, the wise  one should proceed to that prescribed for
the Homa sacrifice, which is  to be performed (44). The offering of oblations (as above described),
commencing with the three offerings made to Vishnu and ending with the  offering to Agni and Soma, is
called Dhara Homa (45).
When making any offering, both the Deva, to which the same is being  made, and the thing offered should be
mentioned, and upon the  conclusion of the principal rite he should perform the Svishti−krit  Homa (46). O
Beautiful One! in the Kali Age there is no Prayashchitta  Homa. The object thereof is attained by Svishti−krit
and Vyahriti Homas  (47). O Devi! (for Svishti−krit Homa.) ghee should be taken in manner  above
mentioned, and, whilst mentally reciting the name of Brahma,  oblation should be offered with the following:
Mantra
Hring, O Deva of the Devas! do Thou make faultless any shortcomings  that there may be in this rite, and
anything done needlessly, whether  by negligence or mistake. Svaha (48−49).
Then oblation should be offered to Fire, thus:
Mantra
Hring, O Fire! Thou art the Purificator of all things. Thou makest  all sacrifices propitious, and art the Lord of
all. Thou art the  Witness of all sacrificial rites, and the Insurer of their success. Do  Thou fulfil all my desires
(50).
The sacrificing priest, having thus concluded the Svishti−krit Homa,  should thus (pray to the Supreme
Brahman):
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
118

Mantra
O Supreme Brahman! O Omnipresent One! for the  removal of the  effects of whatsoever has been improperly
done in this sacrifice, and  for the success of the sacrifice, I am making this Vyahriti Homa.
Saying this, he should offer three oblations with the three
Mantras
Hring Bhuh Svaha,
Hring Bhuvah Svaha,
Hring Svah Svaha.
Thereafter offering one more oblation with the
Mantra
Hring Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah Svaha,
the wise priest should, jointly with the giver of the sacrifice,  offer the complete oblation (51−53). If the latter
has performed the  sacrifice without a priest, he should offer the oblation himself. This  is the rule in
Abhisheka and other observances (54). The Mantra for the  complete oblation is 
Mantra
Hring, O Lord of Sacrifice! may this Sacrifice of mine be complete.  May all the Devatas of sacrifices be
pleased and grant that which is  desired. Svaha (55).
The wise one should then, with the giver of the sacrifice, stand up,  and, with a well−controlled mind, offer
oblations with fruit and pan  leaves, uttering the while the aforesaid Mantra (56).
The learned one should, after offering the complete oblation,  perform Shanti−karma. Taking water from the
sprinkling vessel, he  should with kusha grass sprinkle it over the heads of the persons  present (57), reciting the
Mantra
May the water be friendly to me, may water be like a medicament to  me, may water preserve me always;
water is Narayana Himself (58). Do  thou, O water! grant me happiness and my earthly desires, and so forth.
Having said this, and sprinkled water over the heads of those  present, throw a few drops on the ground,
saying (59):
Mantra
To those who are ever hostile to me, and to those to whom we are  ever hostile, may water be their enemy and
engulf them (60).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
119

Sprinkling a few drops of water in the North−East corner to the  accompaniment of the above−mentioned
Mantra, the kusha grass should be  put away, and supplication should be made to the Carrier of oblations  as
follows (61):
Mantra
O Carrier of Oblations! do Thou grant unto me understanding,  knowledge, strength, intelligence, wisdom,
faith, fame, fortune,  health, energy, and long life (62).
Having thus prayed to Fire, he should, O Shiva! be bidden to depart  with the following (63):
Mantra
Sacrifice! do thou depart to the Lord of Sacrifice.
Fire! do thou depart to the Sacrifice itself.
Lord of Sacrifice! do Thou depart to Thine own place and fulfil my  desires (64).
Then saying, "Fire, forgive me," the Fire should be moved to the  South by pouring oblations of curd on the
North of Fire (65). Then the  worshipper should give a present to Brahma, and, after bowing to him
respectfully, bid him go, and, with the ashes adhering to the ladle,  the officiating priest should then make a
mark on his own forehead and  on that of the giver of the sacrifice, uttering the
Mantra
Hring, Kling, do thou bring peace; mayest thou cause prosperity  (66−67). By the grace of Indra, of Agni, of
the Maruts, Brahma, the  Vasus, the Rudras, and Praja−pati, may there be peace, may there be  prosperity.
Whilst saying this Mantra, he should place a flower on his own head.  Thereafter the giver of the sacrifice
should, as his means allow, offer  presents for the success of the sacrifice and for the Kushandika rite  (68−69).
I have spoken to Thee, O Devi! of Kushandika, which is the  groundwork of all auspicious ceremonies, and
which all Kula worshippers  should with care perform at the commencement thereof (70).
O Auspicious One! I will now speak to Thee of Charu−karma, in order  to insure the ritual success in those
families in which the cooking of  charu is a traditional practice in the performance of all rites (71).  The pot for
cooking charu should be made of either copper or mud (72).  In the first place, the articles should be
consecrated according to the  rules prescribed in Kushandika, and then the pot of charu should be  placed in
front of the worshipper (73). After careful examination to  see that it is without holes and unbroken, a blade of
kusha grass of  the length of a pradesha should be put in the pot (74). The rice should  be placed near the
square and then, O Adored of the Devas! the names of  such of the Devas as are to be worshipped in each
particular ceremony  should be uttered in the dative case, followed by the words "to please  Thee," and then "I
take," "I place it in the pot," and "I put water  into it," and put four handfuls of rice in the name of each Deva.
He  should then take the rice, put it in the pot, and pour water over it  (75−77). O Virtuous One! milk and
sugar should be added thereto, as is  done in cooking. The whole should then be well and carefully cooked
over the consecrated fire (78). And when he is satisfied that it is  well cooked and soft, the sacrificial ladle,
filled with ghee, should  be let into it (79). Thereafter placing the pot on kusha grass on the  northern side of
the Fire, and adding ghee to the charu three times,  the pot should be covered with blades of kusha grass (80).
Then,  putting a little ghee into the sacrificial spoon, a little charu should  be taken from the pot. With it Janu

Homa is done (81). Then, after  doing Dhara Homa, oblations should be made with the Mantras of the  Devas,
who are directed to be worshipped in the principal rite (82).  Completing the principal Homa after
performance of Svishti−krit Homa,  expiatory Homa should be performed, and the rite thus completed (83).  In
the sacramental and consecratory ritual this is the method to be  observed. In all auspicious ceremonies it
should be followed for the  complete success thereof (84).
Now,O Mahamaya! I will speak of Garbhadhana and other rites. I will  speak of them in their order, beginning
with Ritusangskara. Do Thou  listen (85).
After performing his daily duties and purifying himself, (the  priest) should worship the five deitiesBrahma,
Durga, Ganesha, the  Grahas, and the Dikpalas (86). They should be worshipped in the jars on  the East side of
the square, and then the sixteen Matrikasnamely, Gauri  and othersshould be worshipped in their order (87).
The sixteen  Matrikas are Gauri, Padma, Shachi, Medha, Savitri, Vijaya, Jaya,  Deva−sena, Svadha, Svaha,
Shanti, Pushti, Dhriti, Kshama, the  worshipper's own tutelary Devata, and the family Devata (88).
Mantra
May the Mothers that cause the joy of the Devas come and bring all  success to weddings, vratas, and yajnas.
May they come upon their  respective carriers, and in all the fulness of their power, in their  benign aspect, and
add to the glory of this festival (89−90).
Having thus invoked the Mothers and worshipped them to the best of  his powers, the priest should make five
or seven marks with vermilion  and sandal paste on the wall, at the height of his navel, and within  the space of
a pradesha (91).
The wise one should then, whilst breathing the three VijasKling,  Hring, and Shringpour an unbroken stream
of ghee from each of the said  marks, and there worship the Deva Vasu (92). The wise man, having thus  made
the Vasu−dhara according to the directions which I have given, and  having made the square and placed the
Fire thereupon, and consecrated  the articles requisite for Homa, should then cook the excellent charu  (93).
Charu which is cooked in this (Ritu−sangskara) is called  Prajapatya, and the name of this Fire is Vayu. After
concluding Dhara  Homa, the rite of Ritu−sangs−kara should be begun (94). Three oblations  of charu should
be offered with the
Mantra
Hring. salutation to Prajapati. Svaha.
The one oblation should be offered with the following (95):
Mantra
May Vishnu grant the power to conceive. May Tvashta give the form.  May Prajapati sprinkle it, and may
Dhata give the power to bear (96).
This oblation should be made with either ghee or charu, or with ghee  and charu, and should be offered
meditating upon the Sun, Vishnu, and  Prajapati (97).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

Mantra
May Sinibali give support to thy womb, may Sarasvati give support to  thy womb, may the two Ashvins, who
wear garlands of lotuses, give  support to thy womb (98).
Meditating upon the Devis Sinibali and Sarasvati and the two  Ashvins, excellent oblations should be offered
with the above Mantra,  followed by Svaha (99). Then oblation should be offered to the  sanctified Fire,
meditating upon Surya and Vishnu with the
Mantra
Kling, String, Hring, Shring, Hung, grant conception to her, who  desires a son: Svaha (100).
Then, in the name of Vishnu, oblations should be offered with the  following:
Mantra
As this extended Earth ever carries a full womb, do thou likewise  carry for ten months until delivery. Svaha
(101).
Meditating upon the Supreme Vishnu, let a little more ghee be thrown  into the Fire with the following:
Mantra
Vishnu! do Thou in Thy excellent form put into this woman an  excellent son: Svaha (102).
And, uttering the following
Mantra
Kling, Hring, Kling, Hring, String, Hring, Kling,  Hring,
let the husband touch his wife's head (103). Then the husband,  surrounded by a few married women having
sons, should place both hands  on the head of his wife, and, after meditating on Vishnu, Durga, Vidhi  and
Surya, place three fruits on the cloth of her lap. Thereupon he  should bring the ceremony to a close by
making Svishti−krit oblations  and expiatory rites (104−105). Or the wife and husband may be purified  by
worshipping Gauri and Shangkara in the evening, and by giving  oblations to Sun (106).
I have now spoken of Ritu−sangskara. Now listen to that relating to  Garbhadhana (107). On the same night,
or on some night having a date of  an even number, after the ceremony, the husband should enter the room
with his wife, and, meditating on Prajapati, should touch his wife and  say:
Mantra
Hring, O Bed! be thou propitious for the begetting of a good  offspring of us two (108−109).
He should then with the wife get on the bed, and there sit with his  face towards the East or the North. Then,
looking at his wife, let him  embrace her with his left arm, and, placing his right hand over her  head, let him
make japa of the Mantra on the different parts of her  body (as follows) (110): Let him make japa over the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
122

head of the Kama  Vija a hundred times; over her chin of the Vagbhava Vija a hundred  times; over the throat
of the Rama Vija twenty times; and the same Vija  a hundred times over each of her two breasts (111). He
should then  recite the Maya Vija ten times over her heart, and twenty−five times  over her navel. Next let him
place his hand on her member, and recite  jointly the Kama and Vagbhava Vijas a hundred and eight times,
and let  him similarly recite the same Vijas over his own member a hundred and  eight times; and then, saying
the Vija "Hring," let him part the lips  of her member, and let him go into her with the object of begetting a
child (112−113). The husband should, at the time of the spending of his  seed, meditate on Brahma, and,
discharging it below the navel into the  Raktikanadi in the Chitkunda, he should at the same time recite the
following (114, 115):
Mantra
As the Earth is pregnant of Fire, as the Heaven is pregnant of  Indra, as the Points of the compass are pregnant
of the Air they  contain, so do thou also become pregnant (by this my seed) (116).
If the wife then, or at a subsequent period, conceive, the  householder, O Maheshvari! should perform in the
third month after  conception the Pungsavana rite (117). After the performance of his  daily duties, the husband
should worship the five Devas and the  heavenly Mothers, Gauri and others, and should make the Vasu−dhara
(118).
The wise one should then perform Briddhi Shraddha, and, as  aforementioned, the ceremonies up to
Dhara−Homa, and then proceed to  the Pungsavana rites (119). The charu prepared for Pungsavana is called
"Prajapatya," and the fire is called Chandra (120). One grain of barley  and two Masha beans should be put
into curd made from cow's milk, and  this should be given to the wife to drink, and, whilst she is drinking  it,
she should be asked three times: "What is that thou art drinking,O  gentle one?" (121). The wife should make
answer: "Hring, I am drinking  that which will cause me to bear a son." In this manner the wife should  drink
three mouthfuls of the curd (122). The wife should then be led by  women whose husbands and children are
living to the place of sacrifice,  and the husband should there seat her on his left and proceed to  perform
Charu−Homa (123).
Taking a little charu as aforementioned, and uttering the Maya Vija  and the Kurcha Vija, he should offer it as
oblation, with the following:
Mantra
Do thou destroy, do thou destroy all these Bhutas, Pretas,  Pishachas, and Vetalas, who are inimical to
conception and destroyers  of the child in the womb, and of the young. Do thou protect (the child  in) the
womb, do thou protect (the child in) the womb (124−125).
Whilst reciting the above Mantra, meditate upon Fire, as  Raksko−ghna, and on Rudra and Prajapati, and then
offer twelve  oblations (126).
He should then offer five oblations with the
Mantra
Hring, Salutation to Chandra. Svaha.
And then, touching his wife's heart, breathe inwardly the Vijas  Hring and Shring one hundred times (127). He
should then perform  Svishti−krit Homa and Prayash−chitta, and complete the ceremony.  Panchamrita should
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
123

be given in the fifth month of pregnancy 128).  Sugar, honey, milk, ghee, and curd in equal quantities make
Panchamrita. It is needful for the purification of the body (129).  Breathing the Vijas Aing, Kling, Shring,
Hring, Hung, and Lang, five  times over each of the five ingredients, the husband, after mixing them  together,
should cause his wife to eat it (130). Then, in the sixth or  eighth month, the Simantonnayana rite should be
performed. It may,  however, be performed any time before the child is born (131). The wise  one should, after
performing the rites as aforementioned, do  Dhara−Homa, and sit with his wife on a seat, and offer three
oblations  to Vishnu, Surya, and Brahma, saying:
Mantra
To Vishnu Svaha, to the Effulgent One Svaha, to Brahma Svaha (132).
Then, meditating on Chandra, let him offer seven oblations to Soma  into Fire under his name of Shiva (133).
Then, O Shiva! he should  meditate upon the Ashwins, Vasava, Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Prajapati and  offer five
oblations to each of them (134). The husband should after  that take a gold comb, and comb back the hair on
each side of the head  and tie it up with the chignon (135). He should, whilst so combing the  hair, meditate
upon Shiva, Vishnu. and Brahma, and pronounce the Maya  Vija (136) and the
Mantra
O Wife! thou auspicious and fortunate one, thou of auspicious vows!  do thou in the tenth month, by the grace
of Vishva−karma, be safely  delivered of a good child. May thou live long and happy. This comb, may  it give
thee strength and prosperity!
Saying this Mantra, the ceremony should be completed with  Svishti−krit Homa and other rites (137−138).
Immediately after the  birth of the son the wise one should look upon his face and present him  with a piece of
gold, and then in another room perform Dhara Homa in  the manner already described (139). He should then
offer five oblations  to Agni, Indra, Prajapati, the Vishva−devas, and Brahma (140).
The father should thereafter mix equal quantities of honey and ghee  in a bell−metal cup, and, breathing the
Vagbhava Vija over it a hundred  times, make the child swallow it (141). It should be put into the  child's
mouth with the fourth finger of the right hand, with the  following:
Mantra
Child, may thy life, vitality, strength, and intelligence ever  increase (142).
After performing this rite for the longevity of the child, the  father should give him a secret name, by which at
the time of the  investiture with the sacred thread he should be called (143). The  father should then finish the
Jata−karma by the performance of the  usual expiatory and other rites, and then the midwife should with
firmness cut the umbilical cord (144). The period of uncleanliness  commences only after the cord is cut;
therefore all rites relating to  the Devas and the Pitris should be performed before the cord is cut  (145). If a
daughter is born, all the acts as above indicated are to be  performed, but the Mantras are not to be said. In the
sixth or eighth  month the boy should be given the name by which he is usually known  (146). At the time of
naming of the child the mother should, after  bathing him and dressing him in two pieces of fine cloth, come
to and  place him by the side of her husband, with his face towards the East  (147). The father should
thereupon sprinkle the head of the child with  water taken up upon blades of kusha grass and gold, saying at
the time  the following:
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
124

Mantra
May Jahnavi, Yamuna, Reva, the holy Sarasvati, Narmada, Varada,  Kunti, the Oceans and Tanks, Lakesall
these bathe thee for the  attainment of Dharmma, Kama, and Artha (149).
O Waters! thou art the Pranava, and thou givest all happiness. Do  thou therefore provide for us food in (this)
world, and do thou also  enable us to see the Supreme and Beautiful (Para−brahman). Water! thou  art not
different from the Pranava. Grant that we may enjoy in this  world thy most beneficent essence. Your wishes
arise of themselves  spontaneously like those of mothers. Water! thou art the very form of  Pranava. We go to
enjoy to our fill that essence of thine by which thou  satisfieth (this Universe). May thou bring us enjoyment
therein  (150−152).
The wise one should sprinkle water over the child, with the three  preceding Mantras, and then, as aforesaid,
consecrate the fire and  perform the rites leading up to Dhara Homa in the manner already  described, and then
should offer five oblations (153). He should make  the oblation to Agni, then to Vasava, then to Prajapati, then
to the  Vishva−Devas, and then to Yahni under his name of Parthiva (154).
Then, taking the son in his lap, the prudent father should speak  into his right ear an auspicious nameone that
is short, and that can  easily be pronounced (155). After whispering the name three times into  the son's ear, he
should inform the Brahmanas who are present of it,  and then conclude the ceremony with Svishtikrit Homa
and the other  concluding rites (156).
For a daughter there is no Nishkramana, nor is Vriddhi Shraddha  necessary. The wise man performs the
naming, the giving of the first  rice, and tonsure of a daughter without any Mantra (157).
In the fourth or sixth month after birth the Nishkramana Sangskara  ceremony of the son should be performed
(158).
After performing his daily duties, the father should, after bathing,  worship Ganesha, and then bathe and adorn
his son with clothes and  jewels, and, placing him in front of himself, pronounce the following  (159):
Mantra
Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Ganesha, Bhaskara, Indra, Vayu,  Kuvera, Varuna, Agni, and Brihaspati, may
They always be propitious to  this child, and may They always protect him throughout his going forth  from
the house (160).
Having said this, he should take the child in his arms, and,  preceded by vocal and instrumental music, and
surrounded by his  rejoicing kinsmen, take the son out of the house (161). Going a little  distance, he should
show the Sun to the child, with the following (162):
Mantra
Ong, yonder is the Eye (of Heaven) who excels even Shukra in his  effulgence, who is beneficent even to the
Devas. May we see him a  hundred years. May we live a hundred years (163).
Having shown the Sun to his child, the father should return to his  own house, and, after making offering to
the Sun, feast his kinsmen  (164). O Shiva! in the sixth or eighth month either the father's  brother or the father
himself should give the first rice to the child  (165). After worshipping the Devas and purifying fire as
aforementioned, and duly performing the ceremonies leading to Dhara  Homa, the father should make five
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
125

oblations to Fire, under his name of  Shuchi, to each of the following Devas: He should make the oblations
first to Agni, next to Vasava, after him to Prajapati, then to the  Vishva−devas, and then the fifth ahuti to
Brahma (166−168). He should  then meditate upon the Devi Annada, and, after giving Her five  oblations in
Fire, place the son, adorned with clothes and jewels, in  his lap, and give him payasa, either in the same or in
another room  (169). The payasa should be put into the child's mouth five times,  uttering the Mantras for
making oblations to the five vital airs; and  after that a little rice and curry should be put into the child's mouth
(170). The ceremony should be brought to a close by the blowing of  conches and horns and other music, and
by performing the concluding  expiatory rite.
I have done speaking of the rice−eating ceremony. I shall now speak  of the tonsure ceremony. Do Thou listen
(171).
In the third or fifth year, according to the custom in the family,  the tonsure of the boy should be performed
for the success of the  sacramental rites of the boy (172). The wise father should, after  concluding the
preliminary rites leading up to Dhara Homa, place on the  north side of the Fire, called Satya, a mud platter
filled with  cow−dung, tila−seeds, and wheat, also a little lukewarm water and a  keen−edged razor (173−174).
The father should place the son on his mother's lap, the mother  sitting on her husband's left, and, after
breathing the Varuna Vija ten  times over the water, rub the hair of the boy's head with lukewarm  water. He
should then tie the hair with two blades of kusha grass into  a knot, uttering meanwhile the Maya Vija
(175−176). Then, saying the  Maya and Lakshmi Vijas three times, he should cut off the knot with the  steel
razor and place it in the hands of the child's mother (177). The  boy's mother should then take it with both
hands and place it in the  platter containing the cow−dung, and the father should then say to the  barber:
"Barber, do thou at thine ease proceed with the shaving of the  boy's hair, Svaha." Then, looking at the barber,
he should make three  oblations to Prajapati, into Vahni, under his name of Satya (178−179).  After the boy
has been shaved by the barber he should be bathed and  adorned with clothes and jewels, and placed near the
fire on the left  of his mother, and the father should, after performance of Svishti−krit  Homa and the expiatory
rites, offer the complete oblation (180−181).  Then, uttering the following:
Mantra
Hring, O Child! may the omnipresent Creator of the Universe grant  thee well−being,
he should pierce the ears of the boy with gold or silver needles  (182). He should then sprinkle the child with
water, uttering the
Mantra
O Water! thou art, etc. (aforementioned);
and, after performing Shanti Karma and other rites, and making  presents, bring the ceremony to a close (183).
The sacramental rites  from Garbhadhana to Chudakarana are common to all castes. But for  Shudras and
Samanyas they must be performed without Mantras (184).
In the case of the birth of a daughter all castes are to perform the  rites without Mantras. In the case of a
daughter there is no  Nishkramana (185).
I will now speak of the Sacred Thread Ceremony of the twice−born  classes, by which the twice−born become
qualified for performing rites  relating to the Devas and Pitris (186).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
126

In the eighth year from conception, or the eighth year after birth,  the boy should be invested with the sacred
thread. After the sixteenth  year the son should not be invested, and one so invested is  disqualified for all rites
(187).
The learned man should, after finishing his daily duties, worship  the five Devas, as also the Matrikas, Gauri,
and others, and make the  Vasudhara (188). He should thereafter perform Briddhi Shraddha for the
satisfaction of the Devas and Pitris, and perform the rites, ending  with Dhara Homa, as directed in the
performance of Kushandika (189).
The boy should be given a little to eat; then his head, with the  exception of the crown lock, should be shaved,
and after that he should  be well bathed and decked with jewels and silken clothes (190).
The boy should then be taken to the Chhaya−mandapa, near Fire, under  his name of Samudbhava, and there
made to sit on a clean seat to the  left (of his father or Guru) (191). The Guru should say: "My son, dost  thou
adopt Brahma−charyya?" The disciple should say respectfully: "I do  adopt it" (192). The Preceptor should
then with a cheerful mind give  two pieces of Kashaya cloth for the long life and strength of mind of  the
gentle boy (193). Then when the boy has put on the Kashaya cloth,  he should, without speaking, give him a
knotted girdle made of three  strings of munja or kusha grass (194). On that the boy should say,  "Hring, may
this auspicious girdle prove propitious"; and, saying this,  and putting it round his waist, let him sit in silence
before the Guru  (195).
Mantra
This sacrificial thread is very sacred; Brihaspati of old wore it.  Do thou wear this excellent white sacrificial
thread which contributes  to prolong life. May it be for thee strength and courage (196).
With this Mantra the boy should be given a sacrificial thread made  of the skin of the black buck, as also a
staff  made of bamboo, or a  branch of Khadira, Palasha, or Kshira trees (197). When the boy has put  the
sacred thread round his neck and holds the staff in his hand, the  Guru should three times recite the
Mantra
"O Water! thou art," etc. (aforementioned),
preceded and followed by Hring, and should sprinkle the boy with  water taken with kusha grass, and fill the
joined palms of the latter  with water (198). After the boy has offered the water to Suryya, the  Guru should
show the boy the Sun, and recite the
Mantra
"Yonder is the Sun," etc. (aforementioned) (199).
After the boy has viewed the Sun, the Guru should address him as  follows: "My Son! place thy mind on my
observances. I bestow upon thee  my disposition. Do thou follow the observances with an undivided mind.
May my word contribute to thy well−being" (200). After saying this, the  Guru, touching the boy's heart,
should ask, "My Son! what is thy name?"  and the boy should make reply: " . . . Sharmma, I bow to thee"
(201).  And to the question of the Guru, "Whose Brahma−chari art thou?" the  disciple will reverently answer:
"I am thy Brahma−chari" (202). The  Guru should thereupon say: "Thou art the Brahma−chari of Indra, and
Fire is thy Guru." Saying this, the good Guru should consign him to the  protection of the Devas (203). "My
Son! I give thee to Prajapati, to  Savitri, to Varuna, to Prithivi, to the Vishva−devas, and to all the  Devas. May
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
127

they all ever protect thee" (204).
The boy should thereafter go round the sacrificial fire and the  preceptor, keeping both upon his right, and
then resume his own seat  (205). The Guru, O Beloved! should then, with his disciple touching  him, offer five
oblations to Five Devas (206)namely, Prajapati, Shukra,  Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva (207). When the
oblations are offered into  Fire, under his name of Samud−bhava, the names of each of the Devas  should be
pronounced in the dative, preceded by Hring and followed by  Svaha. Where there is no Mantra mentioned,
this method is to be  followed in all cases (208). After this, oblation should be offered to  Durga, Mahalakshmi,
Sundari, Bhuvaneshvari, Indra, and the other nine  regents of the quarters, and Bhaskara and the eight planets
(209). The  name of each of these should be mentioned whilst the offering of  oblations is made. The wise
Guru should then cover the boy with cloth,  and ask him, who is desirous of attaining Brahma−charyya:
"What is the  ashrama thou desirest, my son! and what is thy heart's desire?" (210).  The disciple should
thereupon hold the feet of the Preceptor, and, with  a reverent mind, say: "First instruct me in Divine
Knowledge, and then  in that of the householder" (211).
O Shiva! when the disciple in this manner has thus beseeched his  Guru, the latter should three times whisper
into his disciple's right  ear the Pranava, which contains all the Mantras in itself, and should  also utter the
three Vyahritis, as also the Savitri (212). Sadashiva is  its Rishi, the verse is Trishtup, the presiding Deva is
Savitri, and  its object is the attainment of final liberation (213). The Gayatri  Mantra is:
Mantra
Ong, let us contemplate the wonderful Spirit of the Divine Creator.  May He direct our understanding, Ong.
The Guru should then explain the meaning of the Gayatri (214−215).  By the Tara, which contains the
lettersi.e., A, U, and Mthe  Paresh is meant. He Who is the Protector, Destroyer, and Creator. He is  the Deva
Who is above Prakriti (106).
This Deva is the Spirit of the three worlds, containing in Himself  the three qualities. By the three Vyahritis,
therefore, the  all−pervading Brahman is expressed (217). He Who is expressed by the  Pranava and the
Vyahritis is also known by the Savitri. Let us meditate  upon the sublime, all−pervading eternal Truth, the
great immanent and  lustrous energy, adored by the self−controlled; Savita, effulgent and  omnipresent One,
Whose manifested form the world is, the Creator. May  Bharga, Who witnesseth all, and is the Lord of all,
direct and engage  our mind, intelligence, and senses towards those acts, which lead to  the attainment of
Dharmma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha (218−220).
O Devi! the excellent Guru, having thus instructed the disciple, and  explained to him the Divine Wisdom,
should direct him in the duties of  a householder (221). "My Son! do thou now discard the garments of a
Brahma−chari, and honour the Devas and Pitris according to the way  revealed by Shambhu" (222). Thy body
is sanctified by the instructions  thou hast received in Divine Wisdom. Do thou, now that thou hast  reached
the stage of a householder, engage thyself in thy duties  appropriate to that mode of life (223). Put on two
sacred threads, two  good pieces of cloth, jewels, shoes, umbrella, fragrant garland, and  paste (224). The
disciple should then take off his Kashaya cloth and  his sacred thread of black−buck skin and his girdle, and
give them and  his staff, begging−bowl, and also what has been received by him in the  shape of customary
alms, to his Guru.
He should then put on two sacred threads and two fine cloths, and  wear a garland of fragrant fiowers, and
perfume himself, and thereafter  sit in silence near the Guru, who should address him as follows  (225−227):
"Conquer the senses, be truthful and devoted to the acquisition of  Divine Knowledge and the study of the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
128

Vedas, and discharge the duties  of a householder according to the rules prescribed in the Dharmma  Shastras"
(228).
Having thus instructed the disciple, the Guru should make him offer  three oblations into Fire in the name of
Samudbhava with the
Mantra
Hring, Earth, Firmament, and Heaven, Ong.
He should then himself perform Svishti−krit Homa, and then, O Gentle  One! he should bring the investiture
ceremony to a close by offering  the complete oblation (229−230).
Beloved! all ceremonies, from the Jivaseka to Upana−yana ceremonies,  are performed by the father alone.
The ceremony relating to marriage  may be performed either by the father or by the bridegroom himself  (231).
The pious man should on the day of marriage perform his  ablutions and finish his daily duties, and should
then worship the five  Devas and the Divine Mothers, Gauri and others, and making the  Vasu−dhara do
Briddhi Shraddha (232). At night the betrothed  bridegroom, preceded by vocal and musical instrumental
music, should be  brought to the chhaya−mandapa and seated on an excellent seat (233).  The bridegroom
should sit facing the East, and the giver of the bride  should face the west, and the latter, after rinsing his
mouth, should,  with the assisting Brahmanas, say the words "Svasti" and "Riddhi" (234).
The giver of the bride should ask after the bridegroom's welfare,  and ask also his permission to honour him,
and upon receiving his  answer should honour him by the offer of water for his feet and the  like (235), and
saying, "I give this to you," let him give the  bridegroom the gifts. The water should be given at the feet and
the  oblation at the head (236). Articles for the rinsing of the mouth  should be offered at the mouth, and then
scents, garlands, two pieces  of good cloth, beautiful ornaments and gems, and a sacred thread should  be given
to the bridegroom (237), The giver should make madhu−parka by  mixing together curd, ghee, and honey in a
bell−metal cup, and place it  in the hand of the bridegroom with the words, "I give you" (238). The
bridegroom, after taking it, should place the cup in his left hand,  and, dipping the thumb and ring fingers of
his right hand into the  madhu−parka, should smell it five times, reciting meanwhile the  Pranahuti Mantra, and
then place the cup on his north. Having offered  the madhu−parka, the bridegroom should be made to rinse his
mouth  (239−240).
The giver of the daughter should then, holding durva and akshata,  touch the right knee of the bridegroom
with his hand, and then, first  meditating on Vishnu and saying "Tat Sat," he should mention the name  of the
month, the paksha, and tithi, and then the names of the gotra  and pravara of the bridegroom and his ancestors
one by one, from the  great−grandfather, beginning with the last, and ending with the father.  The bridegroom's
name should be in the objective, and the names of the  others in the possessive case. Then follow the bride's
name and the  names of her ancestors, their gotras, etc.; and he should then say: "I  honour thee with the object
of giving her to thee in Brahma marriage"  (241−244).
The bridegroom should then say: "I am honoured." The giver upon this  should say, "Perform the ordained
marriage rites," and the bridegroom  should then say: "I do it to the best of my knowledge" (245). The  bride,
adorned with beautiful clothes and jewels, and covered with  another piece of cloth, should then be brought
and placed in front of  the bridegroom (246). The giver of the bride should once again show his  respect to the
bridegroom by the present of clothes and ornaments, and  join the right hand of the bridegroom with that of
the bride (247). He  should place in their joined hands five gems or a fruit and a pan−leaf,  and, having saluted
the bride, should consign her to his hands (248).  At the time of consigning the bride the giver should, as
before,  mention his name twice in the nominative case, and should state his  wish, and should also mention
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
129

the names of the three ancestors of the  bridegroom, with their gotras, all in the possessive case, as before.
He should then mention the name of the bridegroom in the dative  singular, and then the names of the three
ancestors of the bride, with  their gotras, etc., in the possessive case. At the time of mentioning  the bride's
name in the objective singular he should say after that,  "The honoured, adorned, clothed, and
Prajapati−devataka," and saying,  "to thee I give," he should give away the bride. The bridegroom should,
saying "Svasti," agree to take her as his wife (249−251). Let the giver  then say, "In Dharmma, in Artha, in
Kama, thou should be with thy  wife;" and the bridegroom should reply, saying, "So I shall," and then  recite
the praise of Kama (252).
Mantra
It is Kama who gives and Kama who accepts. It is Kama who has taken  the Kamini for the satisfaction of
Kama. Prompted by Kama, I take thee.  May both our kamas be fulfilled (353).
The giver should then, addressing the son−in−law and the daughter,  say: "May, by the grace of Prajapati, the
desires of you both be  accomplished. May you two fare well. Do you two together perform the  religious
observances" (254). Then both the bride and bridegroom, to  the accompaniment of music and blowing of
conch−shells, should be  covered with the cloth, so that they may have their first auspicious  glance at one
another (255).
Then gold and jewels, according to the giver's means, should be  offered to the son−in−law as presents. The
giver should then think to  himself that the ceremony has been faultlessly done (256). The  bridegroom either,
on the same night or the day following, should  establish fire, according to the rules of Kushandika (257).
The fire that is made in this Kushandika is called Yojaka, and the  charu which is cooked is called Prajapatya.
After performing Dhara Homa  in the fire, the bridegroom should offer five oblations (258). The  oblation
should, after meditation upon Shiva, Durga, Brahma, Vishnu,  and the Carrier of Thunder, be made to them
one after the other singly  in the sanctified fire (259). Taking both his wife's hands, the husband  should say: "I
take thy hands, O fortunate one! Do thou be devoted to  the Guru and the Devatas, and duly perform thy
household duties  according to the religious precepts" (260). The wife should then, with  ghee given by the
husband, and fried paddy given by her brother, make  four oblations in the name of Prajapati (261). The
husband should then  rise from his seat with his wife and go round the Fire with her and  offer oblations to
Durga and Shiva, Rama and Vishnu, Brahmi and Brahma,  three times to each couple (262).
Then, without reciting any Mantra, the bride should step on a stone,  and, standing thereon, the bride should
take seven steps. If the  Kushamdika ceremony is performed at night, the bride and bridegroom,  surrounded
by the ladies present, should gaze upon the stars Dhruva and  Arundhati (263). Returning to their seats and
seated thereon, the  bridegroom should bring the ceremony to a close by performing  Svishti−krit Homa and
offering complete oblations (264). The Brahma  marriage, according to kula−dharmma, in order to be
faultless, should  take place with a girl of the same caste as the husband, but she should  not be of the same
gotra, nor should she be a sapinda (265). The wife  married according to Brahma rites is the mistress of the
house, and  without her permission another wife should not be married according to  those rites (266). O
Kuleshvari! if the children of the Brahma wife are  living or any of her descendants be living, then the
children of the  Shaiva wife shall not inherit (267).
O Parameshvari! the Shaiva wife and her children are entitled to  food and clothing from the heir of her
Shaiva husband in proportion to  the property of the latter (268). Shaiva marriage celebrated in the  Chakra is
of two kinds. One kind is terminated with the Chakra and the  other is lifelong (269). At the time of the
formation of the Chakra the  Vira, surrounded by his friends, relatives, and fellow−worshippers,  should, with
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
130

a well−controlled mind, by mutual consent, perform the  marriage ceremony (270). He should first of all
submit their wishes,  saying to the Bhairavis and Viras there assembled, "Approve our  marriage according to
Shaiva form" (271). The Vira should, after  obtaining their permission, bow to the Supreme Kalika, repeating
the  Mantra of seven letters (Kalika Mantra) one hundred and eight times  (272).
O Shiva! he should then say to the woman: "Dost thou love me as thy  husband with a guileless heart?" (273).
O Queen of the Devas! the Kaula woman should then honour her beloved  with scents, flowers, and coloured
rice, and with a faithful heart  place her own hands on his (274). The Lord of the Chakra should then  sprinkle
them with the following Mantra, and the Kaulas, seated in the  Chakra, should approve and say: "It is well"
(275)
Mantra
May Raja−rajeshvari, Kali, Tarini, Bhuvaneshvari, Bagala, Kamala,  Nitya, Bhairavi, ever protect thee both
(276).
The Lord of the Chakra should sprinkle them twelve times with wine  or water of oblation, reciting the above
Mantra. The two should then  bow to him, and he should upon that let them hear the Vijas of Vagbhava  and
Rama (277). There is no restriction of caste or age in Shaiva  marriage. By the command of Shambhu, any
woman who is not a sapinda,  and has not already a husband, may be married (278).
The wife married for the purposes of Chakra in the Shaiva form  should, in the case of the Vira who desires
offspring, be released on  the dissolution of the Chakra only after the appearance of her menses.  The offspring
of the Shaiva marriage is of the same caste as the mother  if it be an Anuloma marriage, and a Samanya if the
marriage is Viloma  (279−281). These mixed castes should, at the time of their fathers'  shraddha and other
ceremonies, give presents of edibles to, and feast  the Kaulas only (282).
Eating and sexual union, O Devi! are desired by, and natural to,  men, and their use is regulated for their
benefit in the ordinances of  Shiva (283). Therefore, O Mahe−shani! he who follows the ordinances of  Shiva
undoubtedly acquires Dharmma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha (284).

Chapter 10 − Rites relating to  Vriddhi Shraddha, Funeral
Rites, and Purnabhisheka
SHRI DEVI said:
I have now learned from Thee, O Lord! of the ordinances relating to  Kushandika and the ten Sang−skaras. Do
Thou now, O Deva! reveal to Me  the ordinances relating to Briddhi Shraddha(1). O Shangkara! tell Me in
detail, both for My pleasure and the benefit of all beings, in which of  the sacramental and
dedicatoryceremonies Kushandika and Briddhi  Shraddha should be, or be not, performed. Say this, O
Maheshana (2−3).
Shri Sadashiva said:
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
131

O Gentle One! I have already in detail spoken of all that should be  done in the ten Sangskarascommencing
from Jiva−seka and ending in  marriage (4), and of all that which should be performed by wise men who
desire their own weal.O Beauteous One! I will now speak of what should  be done in other rites. Do Thou
listen to it (5).
My Beloved! in consecrating tanks, wells, and ponds, images of  Devatas houses, gardens and in vrata,the five
Devas and the celestial  Mothers should be worshipped, and the Vasu−dhara should be made and  Briddhi
Shraddha and Kushandika should be performed (6−7). In  ceremonies which may be, and are, performed by
women alone there is no  Briddhi Shraddha, but (in lieu thereof) a present of edibles should be  made for the
satisfaction of the Devatas and the Pitris (8).
O Lotus−faced One! in such ceremonies the worship of the Deva,  Vasu−dhara, and Kushandika should be
devoutly performed by the women  through the aid of priests (9). If a man cannot perform a rite himself,  then
his son, the son's son, the daughter's son, agnate relatives,  sister's son and son−in−law and the priest, are, O
Shiva! the best  substitutes (10). I will, O Kalika! now in detail speak of Briddhi  Shraddha. Do Thou listen to
it (11).
After performing the daily duties, a man should with mind intent  worship Ganga, Vishnu−−the Lord of
Sacrifice, the Divinity of the  homestead, and the King (12); and inwardly reciting the Pranava, he  should
make nine, seven, five, or three Brahmanas of Darbha grass (13).  The Brahmanas should be made with ends
of the grass which have no knots  in them, by twisting the upper ends of the blades from right to left  two and a
half times (14).
In Briddhi Shraddha and Parvana Shraddha there should be six  Brahmanas, but, O Shiva! in Ekoddishta
Shraddha there should be only  one (15). The wise one should place the Brahmanas made of kusha grass  all in
one receptacle, with their faces to the north, and bathe them  with the following (16)
Mantra
May the Divinity of water, who is like the Maya Vija, be propitious  for the attainment of our desire. May He
be propitious in that which we  drink, May He always stand forward for our good (17).
Then with scents and flowers the Brahmanas made with kusha grass  should be worshipped (18). The wise
one should then place on the west  and the south six vessels in pairs with kusha, sesamum−seed, and Tulasi
(19). On the two vessels placed on the west two of the Brahmanas should  be seated facing east, and on the
four seats on the south the four  Brahmanas should be seated facing north (20).
The Divinities should be imagined to be in the two seated on the  west and the paternal Ancestors in the two
seated on the left of those  on the south and the maternal ancestors on the right. Know this, O  Parvati (21).
In Abhyudayika Shraddha the Nandimukha fathers and the Nandimukhi  mothers, as also the maternal
Ancestors in the male line and in the  female line, should be mentioned by name. Before this, however, one
should turn to his right and face the north, and after the performance  of the requisite ceremonies for the
worship of the Devas he should turn  to his left and face the south and perform the rites necessary for the
offering of the Pindas (22−23).
In this Abhyudayika Shraddha, O Shiva! all the rites should be  performed in their order, beginning with the
rites relating to the  Devas, and if there be any deviation the Shraddha fails in its object  (24).
The word of supplication addressed to the Devas should be said  whilst facing the north, and when the same is
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
132

addressed to the paternal  or maternal Ancestors it should be said whilst facing south. And now, O  Thou of
pure Smiles! I will first state the words of entreaty which  should be addressed to the Devas (25).
After mentioning the name of the month and paksha, the tithi and the  occasion, the excellent worshipper
should say "for the prosperous  result of the ceremony." Then he should repeat the names and gotras of  the
three fathers and of the three mothers, and of the three maternal  grandfathers and of the three maternal
grandmothers, in the possessive  case, and he should thereafter say: "I am performing the Shraddha of  the
Vishva−Devas represented by the image of the two Brahmanas made of  kusha grass." These, O Great Devi!
are the words of entreaty" (26−29).
O Parvati! when the Anujna−vakya is either for paternal or maternal  Ancestors, the same words should, with
the necessary alterations, be  said for the paternal and maternal Ancestors, and the Vishva−Devas left  out (30).
Then, O Shiva! the worshipper should recite the Brahma−Vidya  Gayatri ten times (31). He should next say
the following
Mantra
I salute the Divinities, the Fathers−−i.e., the Fathers and  Mothers−−the great Yogis; I salute Pushti and
Svaha; may we have such  auspicious occasions over and over again.
The excellent worshipper, having repeated the above Mantra three  times, and taking water in his hand, should
wash the Shraddha articles  with the
Mantra
Vang, Hung, Phat (32−33).
O Mistress of the Kula! a vessel should next be placed in the corner  of Agni. Then uttering the
Mantra
O Water! Thou art the nectar which killest the Rakshasas, protect  this sacrifice of mine.
Water with Tulasi−leaves and barley should be put into it; and the  wise one should, after first offering
handfuls of water to the Devas  and then to the Vipras, give them seats of kusha grass (34−35).
The learned men, O Shiva! should then invoke the Vishva−Devas, the  fathers, the mothers, the maternal
grandfathers, and the maternal  grandmothers (36). Having so invoked them, the Vishva−Devas should  first be
worshipped; and then the three fathers, the three mothers, the  three maternal grandfathers, and the three
maternal grandmothers should  be worshipped, with offets of Padya, Arghya, Achamaniya, incense,  lights,
cloths. Then, O Beauteous One! permission should be asked in  the first place of the Devas for the spreading
of the leaves (37−38).
Then a four−sided figure should be drawn uttering the Maya Vija, and  then in a similar way for the paternal
and maternal sides two figures  each should be drawn (39). After these have been sprinkled with the  Varuna
Vija, leaves should be spread over the figures. These leaves  should be sprinkled with the Varuna Vija, and
then drinking−water and  different kinds of edibles and rice should be distributed in their  order (40).
After giving honey and grains of barley and sprinkling the offerings  with water, accompanied by the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
133

Mantra
Hrang, Hrung, Phat,
the worshipper possessed of the knowledge of Truth should dedicate  the edibles by the names of the
Vishva−Devas, the fathers, the mothers,  the maternal grandfathers and the maternal grandmothers, and
thereafter  repeat the Gayatri ten times and thrice repeat the
Mantra
"I salute the Divinities," as aforesaid.
After this, O Adya! he should take the directions (of the  officiating Brahmanas) relating to the disposal of the
remnants of  edibles and of the Pindas (41−43).
Upon receiving the directions of the Brahmana, he should, O Beloved!  make twelve Pindas of the size of bael
fruits with the remnants of the  Akshata and other things (44). He should make one more Pinda equal in  size
with the others, and then, O Ambika! he should spread some kusha  grass and barley on the Nairrita corner of
the figure (45).
Mantra
Such of my family as have none to offer Pindas to them whom neither  son nor wife survive, who were burnt
to death or were killed by tigers  or other beast of prey, such kinsmen of mine as themselves are without
kinsmen, all such as were my kinsmen in previous births, may they all  obtain imperishable satisfaction by the
Pinda and water hereby given by  me (46−47).
O Adored of the Devas! having with the above Mantra offered the  Pinda to those who have no one to offer
them Pindas, he should wash his  hands and inwardly recite the Gayatri, and repeat the
Mantra
"I salute the Divinities,"
and so forth, three times, and then make the square (48).
O Devi! the wise man should in front of the vessels containing the  remnants of the offerings make such
squares in twos (for his  Ancestors), beginning with the paternal Ancestors (49).
O Shive! he should then sprinkle the squares with water with the  Mantra already prescribed, and then spread
kusha grass over them and  sprinkle them with the Vayu Vija (49), beginning with the kusha spread  on the
square for the paternal (male) Ancestors, and then offer three  Pindas, one at the top, another at the bottom,
and one in the middle,  in each of the squares (50).
O Maheshvari! the names of each of the Ancestors should be  mentioned, inviting him or her, and then the
Pinda should be given with  honey and barley, concluding with Svadha (51). After the Pindas are  given (in
manner aforesaid) the Lepa−bhoji Ancestors should be  satisfied by the offer to them of the remnants which
remain on the  hand. These should be scattered on all sides with the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
134

Mantra
Ong, may the Lepa−bhoji Ancestors be pleased.
In Ekoddishta Shraddha the offering to the Lepa−bhoji Ancestors is  not made (52).
Then for the satisfaction of the Devas and Pitris the Gayatri should  be inwardly recited ten times, and the
Mantra, "I salute the  Divinities," as aforesaid should be similarly recited three times, and  then the Pindas
should be worshipped (53). Lighting an incense−stick  and a light, the wise one should, with closed eyes,
think of the Pitris  in their celestial forms partaking of their allotted Pindas, each his  own, and should then
bow to them, uttering the following (54)
Mantra
My father is my highest Dharmma. My father is my highest Tapas. My  father is my Heaven. On my father
being satisfied, the whole Universe  is satisfied (55).
Taking up some flowers from the remnants, the Pitris should be asked  for their blessings, with the following
(56)
Mantra
Give me your blessings, O Merciful Pitris. May my knowledge,  progeny, and kinsmen always increase. May
my benefactors prosper. May I  have food in profusion. May many always beg of me, and may I not have  to
beg of any (57−58).
Then he should remove the Devas and Brahmanas made of kusha grass,  as also the Pindas, commencing with
the Devas. The wise one should then  make presents to all three (59).
He should then make japa of the Gayatri ten times, and the Mantra,  "I salute the Divinities," five times, and,
after looking at the fire  and the Sun, should, with folded palms, ask the Vipra the following  question (60):
"Is the Shraddha complete?" and the Brahmana should make reply:
"It has been completed according to the injunctions" (61).
Then, for the removal of the effects of any error or omission, the  Pranava should be inwardly recited ten
times, and the ceremony should  be brought to a close, uttering the following
Mantra
"May the Shraddha rite be faultless";
and then the food and drink in the vessels should be offered to the  officiating Brahmana (62).
In the absence of a Vipra, it should be given to cows and goats, or  should be thrown into water. This is called
"Vriddhi Shraddha,"  enjoined for all obligatory sacramental rites (63). Shraddha performed  on the occasion
of any Parvvan is called "Parvvana Shraddha" (64).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
135

In ceremonies relating to the consecration of emblems or images of  Devas, or while starting for or returning
from pilgrimage, the Shraddha  should be according to the injunctions laid down for Parvvana Shraddha  (65).
On the occasion of Parvvana Shraddha the Pitris should not be  addressed with the prefix "Nandimukha," and
for the words "Salutation  to Pushti" should be substituted the words "Salutation to Svadha" (66).
O Beautiful One! if any of the three Ancestors be alive, then the  wise one should make the offerings to
another Ancestor of higher degree  (67). If the father, grandfather, and great−grandfather be alive, then,  O
Queen of the Devas! no Shraddha need be performed. If they are  pleased, then the object of the funeral rite
and sacrifice is attained  (68).
If his father be living, then a man may perform his mother's  Shraddha, his wife's Shraddha, and
Nandi−mukha Shraddha; but he is not  entitled to perform the Shraddha of anyone else (69).O Queen of the
Kula! at the time of Ekoddishta Shraddha the Vishva−Devas are not to be  worshipped. The word of entreaty
should be addressed to one Ancestor  only (70).
At the time of Ekoddishta Shraddha cooked rice and Pinda should be  given whilst facing south. The rest of
the ceremony is the same as that  which has been already described, with the exception that sesamum  should
be substituted for barley (71).
The peculiarity in Preta Shraddha is that the worship of Ganga and  others is omitted, and in the framing of the
Mantra the deceased should  be spoken of as Preta whilst rice and Pindas are offered to him (72).
The Shraddha performed for one man is called "Ekoddishta." In  offering Pinda to the Preta, fish and meat
should be added (73). O  Mistress of the Kula! know this, that the Shraddha which is performed  on the day
following the end of the period of uncleanliness is Preta  Shraddha (74). If there is a miscarriage, or if the
child dies  immediately on birth, or if a child is born or dies, then the period of  uncleanliness is to be reckoned
according to the custom of the family  (75).
The period of uncleanliness in the case of the twice−born is ten  days (for Brahmanas), twelve (for
Kshatriyas), and a fortnight (for  Vaishyas); for Shudras and Samanyas the period is one month (thirty  days)
(76).
On the death of an Agnate who is not a Sapinda, the period of  uncleanliness is three days, and on the death of
a Sapinda, should  information of it arrive after the period prescribed, one becomes  unclean for three days (77).
The unclean man, O Primordial One! is not entitled to perform any  rite relating to the Devas and the Pitris,
excepting Kula worship and  that which has been already commenced (78).
Persons over five years of age should be burnt in the  burning−ground, but, O Kuleshani! a wife should not be
burnt with her  dead husband (79). Every woman is Thy image−−Thou residest concealed in  the forms of all
women in this world. That woman who in her delusion  ascends the funeral pyre of her lord shall go to hell
(80).
Kalika! the corpses of worshippers of Brahman should be either  buried, thrown into running water, or burnt,
according as they may  direct (81).
Ambika! death in a holy place or a place of pilgrimage, or near the  Devi, or near the Kaulikas, is a happy one
(82).
He who at the time of his death meditates on the one Truth,  forgetful of the three worlds, attains to his own
Essential Being (83).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

After death the corpse should be taken to the burning−ground, and  when it has been washed it should be
smeared with ghee and placed on  the pyre, with the face to the north (84).
The deceased should be addressed by his name, and Gotra and as  Preta. Giving the Pinda to the mouth of the
corpse, the pyre should be  lighted by applying the torch to the mouth of the corpse, inwardly the  while
reciting the Vahni Vija (85).
Beloved! the Pinda should be made of boiled or unboiled rice, or  crushed barley, or wheat, and should be of
the size of an emblic  myrobalam (86). To the eldest son of the Preta is given the privilege  of performing the
Shraddha; in his absence to the other sons, according  to the order of their seniority (87).
The day after the day upon which the period of uncleanliness  expires, the mourner should bathe and purify
himself, and give away  gold and sesamum for the liberation of the Preta (88).
The son of the Preta should give away cattle, lands, clothes,  carriages, vessels made of metals, and various
kinds of edibles, in  order that the Preta may attain Heaven (89).
He should also give away scents, garlands, fruits, water, a  beautiful bed, and everything which the Preta
himself liked to insure  his passage to Heaven (90).
Then a bull should be branded with the mark of a trident, and  decorated with gold and ornaments, and then let
loose, with the object  that the deceased may attain Heaven (91).
He should then with a devout spirit perform the Shraddha, according  to the injunctions laid down for the
performance of Preta Shraddha, and  then feed Brahmanas and Kaulas possessed of Divine knowledge, and
the  hungry (92).
The man who is unable to make gifts should perform the Shraddha to  the best of his ability, and feed the
hungry, and thus liberate his  father from the state of existence of a Preta (93).
This Preta Shraddha is known as Adya or Ekod−dishta Shraddha, and it  liberates the deceased from the state
of Preta. After this every year  on the tithi of his death edibles should be given to the deceased (94).
There is no necessity for a multitude of injunctions nor for a  multitude of rituals. Man may attain all siddhi by
honouring a Kaulika.  The object of all Sangskaras is completely attained if, in lieu of the  prescribed Homa,
Japa, and Shraddha, even a single Kaulika is duly  honoured (96), at the time of the ceremony.
The injunction of Shiva is that all auspicious ceremonies should be  performed between the period beginning
with the fourth day of the light  half of the lunar half−month, and ending on the fifth of the dark  half−month
(97).
He, however, who is desirous of performing any rite which must be  performed may perform it even on an
inauspicious day, provided he be so  directed by his Guru, by a Ritvij, or a Kaulika (98).
A Kaulika should commence the building of a house, should first  enter a house, start on a journey, wear new
jewels, and the like,only  after worshipping the Primordial One with the five Elements (99).
Or the excellent worshipper may shorten the rite. He may thus, after  meditating on the Devi, and inwardly
reciting the Mantra and bowing to  the Devi, go wherever he may desire (100).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

In the worship of all Devatas, such as the Autumnal Festival and  others, dhyana and puja should be
performed according to the ordinances  laid down in the Shastras relating to such worship (101).
According to the ordinances relating to the worship of the  Primordial Kali, animal sacrifice and Homa should
be performed, and the  rite should be brought to an end by the honouring of Kaulikas and  making of offerings
(102).
The general rule is that Ganga, Vishnu, Shiva, Suryya, and  Brahma should first be worshipped, and then the
Deva the special object  of worship (103).
The Kaulika is the most excellent Dharmma, the Kaulika is the most  excellent Deva, the Kaulika is the most
excellent pilgrimage, therefore  should the Kaula be always worshipped (104).
The three and a half kotis of Places of Pilgrimage, all the Devas  beginning with Brahma Himself, reside in
the body of the Kaula. What,  therefore, is there which is not attained by worshipping him? The land  in which
the good and fully initiated Kaula resides is blessed and  deserving of honour. It is most holy, and is coveted
even by the Devas  (105−106). Who can in this world understand the majesty of the fully  initiated Sadhaka,
who is Shiva Himself, and to whom there is nothing  either holy or sinful? (107).
Such a Kaula, possessing merely the form of man, moves about this  earth for the salvation of the entire world
and the instruction of men  in the conduct of life (108).
Shri Devi said:
Thou hast, O Lord! spoken of the greatness of the Soul of the fully  initiated Kaula. Do Thou in Thy mercy
speak to Me of the ordinances  relating to such initiation (109).
Shri Sadashiva said:
In the three Ages this rite was a great secret.; men then used to  perform it in all secrecy, and thus attain
liberation (110).
When the Kali Age prevails, the followers of Kula rite should  declare themselves as such, and, whether in the
night or the day,  should openly be initiated (111).
By the mere drinking of wine, without initiation, a man does not  become a Kaula. The Kula worshipper
becomes the Lord of the Kula Chakra  only after full initiation (112).
The Guru should, the day before the initiation, worship the Deva of  Obstacles with offerings, according to his
ability for the removal of  all obstacles (113).
If the Guru is not qualified to officiate at a full initiation  ceremony, then it should,O Beloved! be performed
by a duly initiated  Kaula (114). Gang is the Vija of Ganapati (Ganesha) (115). Ganaka is  the Rishi, the
Chhanda is Nivrit, the Lord of Obstacles is the  Devata, and the Mantra is applicable for the removal of
obstacles to  the performance of the rite (116).
Adding successively six long vowels to the Mula Mantra,  Shadanga−nyasa should be performed, and O
Shiva! after doing Pranayama  let Ganapati be meditated upon (117).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
138

Dhyana
Meditate on Gana−pati as of the colour of vermilion, having three  eyes, a large belly, holding in His
lotus−hands the conch, the noose,  the elephant−goad, and the sign of blessing. His great trunk adorned  with
the jar of wine which it holds. On His forehead shines the young  Moon. He has the head of the King of
elephants; His cheeks are  constantly bathed in wine. His hody is adorned with the coils of the  King of
servants. He is dressed in red raiment, and His body is smeared  with scented ointments (118).
Having thus meditated upon Ganapati, he should be worshipped with  mental offerings, and then the
protecting power of the seat should be  worshipped. These are Tibra, Jvalini, Nanda, Bhoga−da, Kama−rupini,
Ugra, Tejasvati, Satyi, and Vighna−vinashini. The first eight should be  worshipped in their order, beginning
from the east, and the last should  be worshipped in the middle of the Mandala. Having thus worshipped them
all, the lotus−seat itself should be worshipped (119−120).
Meditating on Ganesha once again, He should be worshipped with  offerings of the five elements. On each of
His four sides should the  excellent Kaulika worship Ganesha, Gana−nayaka, Gana−natha, Gana−krida,
Eka−danta, Rakta−tunda, Lambodara, Gajanana, Mahodara, Vikata,  Dhumrabha, and Vighna−nashana
(121−123).
Then the eight Shaktis, Brahmi, and others, and the ten Dikpalas and  their weapons, should be worshipped,
and after that Vighna−raja should  be bidden to depart (124).
Having thus worshipped the King of Obstacles, the worshipper should  perform the preliminary ceremony,
and then entertain the Kaulas versed  in divine knowledge with the five elements (125).
The next day, having bathed and performed his ordinary daily duties  as already enjoined, he should, O
Beloved! give away sesamum−seed and  gold for the destruction of all sins from his birth, and a bhojya for  the
satisfaction of the Kaulas (126). Then, giving arghya to Suryya,  and having worshipped Brahma, Vishnu,
Shiva, and the nine Planets, as  also the sixteen divine Mothers, he should make a Vasu−dhara (127).
He should then perform Vriddhi Shraddha for the good result of the  rite, and, going up to the Guru, bow to
him, and pray to him as follows  (128):
(Prayer to the Guru)
Save me, O Lord! thou that art the Sun of the Kaulas. Protect my  head, O Ocean of Mercy! with the shade of
thy lotus−foot (129). Grant  us leave, O Exalted One! in this auspicious Purnabhisheka that by thy  grace I may
attain the success of my undertaking without any hindrance  (130).
(The Guru should then reply:)
My son! be thou, by the permission of the Shiva−Shakti, initiated  with the full initiation. May thou attain the
object of thy desire by  the command of Shiva (131).
Having thus obtained the permission of the spiritual Preceptor, he  should make the Sangkalpa for the removal
of all obstacles and for the  attainment of long life, prosperity, strength, and good health (132).
The Sadhaka, having solemnly formed his resolve, should worship the  Guru, by presenting him with clothes
and jewels, and karana with  Shuddhi, and do honour to him (133).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Dhyana

The Guru should then make with earth an altar four fingers in height  and measuring one and a half cubit
either way in a beautiful room  painted with red earth, etc., decorated with pictures, flags, fruits,  and leaves,
and strings of small bells.
The room should have a beautiful ceiling−cloth, lighted with lines  of lamps fed with ghee to dispel all traces
of darkness, and should be  scented with burning camphor, incense−sticks, and incense, and  ornamented with
fans, fly−whisks, the tail feathers of the peacock, and  mirrors, etc., and then he should with rice powdered
and coloured  yellow, red, black, white, and dark blue draw Mandala called  Sarvato−bhadra, beautiful and
auspicious in every way (134−138).
Then each person should perform the rite preparatory to mental  worship, according to his Sangkalpa, and
then, having made mental  worship, should purify the five elements with the Mantra previously  mentioned
(139). After the Pancha−tattvas have been purified, the jar,  which must be either of gold or silver or copper or
earth, should be  placed with the Brahma Vija on the Mandala. It should be washed with  the Weapon Mantra
and smeared with curd, Akshata, and then a vermilion  mark should be placed on it with the Mantra "Shring"
(140−141).
He should then recite three times the letters of the alphabet, with  the Vindu superposed from Ksha to A, and
recite inwardly the Mula  Mantra, and fill the jar with wine or water from some holy place, or  with ordinary
pure water, and then throw into the jar nine gems or gold  (142−143).
The merciful Guru should then place over the mouth of the jar a  leafy branch of a Jack−tree, a Fig−tree, an
Ashvattha−tree, and of a  Vakula and Mango−tree, with the Vagbhava Vija (144).
He should then place on the leafy branch a gold, silver, copper, or  earthen platter, uttering the Rama Vija and
Maya Vija (145). Then, O  Beauteous One! two pieces of cloth should be tied to the neck of the  jar. When
worshipping Shakti the cloth should be of a red colour, and  in the worship of Shiva and Vishnu it should be
white (146).
Inwardly reciting the
Mantra
Sthang, Sthing, Hring, Shring,
the jar should be fixed in its place, and after putting into it the  Pancha−tattvas the nine cups should be placed
in their order (147). The  Shakti Patra should be of silver, the Guru Patra of gold, the Shri  Patra should be
made of the human skull, the rest of copper (148). Cups  made of stone, wood, and iron should be rejected; the
material of the  cups in the worship of the Maha−Devi should be according to the means  of the worshipper
(149).
After placing the cups, libations should be offered to the four  Gurus and the Devi, and the wise one should
then worship the jar filled  with nectar (150). Lights and incense should then be waved and  sacrifices made to
all beings, and after worshipping the divinities of  the pitha he should perform Shadangganyasa (151). He
should then do  Pranayama, and, meditating on the Great Devi, invoke Her, and  thereafter worship Her, the
Object of his worship, to the best of his  ability and without niggardliness (151). The excellent Guru, O Shiva!
should perform all the rites ending with Homa, and then honour the  Kumaris and worshippers of Shakti by
presenting them with flowers,  sandal−paste, and clothes (153).
The Guru should then ask the permission of those present with the  following words:
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
140

O you Kaulas! who are vowed to Kula−worship, be kind to my disciple.  Do you give your permission to his
Sangskara of Purnabhisheka (154).
The Lord of the Chakra, having thus asked those present, should  respectfully say: "By the grace of
Mahamaya and the majesty of the  Supreme Soul, may thy disciple be perfect and devoted to the Supreme
Essence" (155).
The Guru should then make the disciple worship the Devi in the jar,  which has been worshipped by himself,
and then, mentally repeating the
Mantra
Kling, Hring, Shring
over it, move the immaculate jar, with the following
Mantra
Rise, O Brahma−kalasha, thou art the Devata and grantest all  success. May my disciple, being bathed with
thy water and leaves, be  devoted to Brahman (156−157).
Having moved the jar in this manner, the Guru should mercifully  sprinkle the disciple seated with his face to
the North with the Mantra  about to be spoken (158).
The Rishi of the Mantra of this auspicious Purnabhisheka rite  is Sadashiva, the presiding Devata is the Adya
Devata, the Vija is  "Ong," and its applicability is for the auspicious sprinkling on the  occasion of the
Purnabhisheka ceremony (158−159).
Mantra
May the Gurus sprinkle thee. May Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheshvara  sprinkle thee; may the Mothers Durga,
Lakshmi, Bhavani, sprinkle thee;  may Shodashi, Tarini, Nitya, Svaha, Mahisha−mardini, all these sprinkle
thee with the water that has been sanctified by the Mantra; may  Jaya−durga, Vishalakshi, Brahmani,
Sarasvati, may all These sprinkle  thee; may Bagala, Varada, and Shiva sprinkle thee; may the Shaktis,
Narasinghi, Varahi, Vaishnavi, Vana−malini, Indrani, Varuni, Raudri,  sprinkle thee; may Bhairavi,
Bhadra−kali, Tushti, Pushti, Uma, Kshama,  Shraddha, Kanti, Daya, Shanti, always sprinkle thee; may
Maha−kali,  Maha−lakshmi, Maha−nila−sarasvati, Ugra−chanda, Prachanda, constantly  sprinkle thee; may
Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Nrisingha, Vamana, Rama,  Bhrigu−Rama, sprinkle thee with water; may Asitanga,
Ruru, Chanda,  Krodhonmatta, Bhayangkara, Kapali, Bhishana, sprinkle thee; may Kali,  Kapalini, Kulla,
Kurukulla, Virodhini, Viprachitta, Mahogra, ever  sprinkle thee; may Indra, Agni, Shamana, Raksha, Varuna,
Pavana,  Dhana−da, Maheshana, who are the eight Dikpalas, sprinkle thee; may  Ravi, Soma, Mangala, Budha,
Jiva, Sita, Shani, Rahu, Ketu, with all  their Satellites, sprinkle thee; may the stars, the Karanas, the Yogas,  the
Days of the Week, and the two Divisions of the Month, the Days,  Seasons, Months, and the Year anoint thee
always; may the Salt Ocean,  the Sweet Ocean, the Ocean of Wine, the Ocean of Ghee, the Ocean of  Curd, the
Ocean of Milk, the Ocean of Sweet Water sprinkle thee with  their consecrated waters; may Ganga, Yamuna,
Reva, Chandra−bhaga,  Sarasvati, Sarayu, Gandaki, Kunti, Shveta−ganga, Kaushiki, may all  these sprinkle
thee with their consecrated waters; may the great Nagas  beginning with Ananta, the birds beginning with
Garuda, the trees  beginning with the Kalpa tree, and the great Mountains sprinkle thee;  may the beneficent
Beings residing in Patala, on the earth, and in the  air, pleased at this hour of thy Purnabhisheka, sprinkle thee
with  water (160−175). May thy ill−luck, bad name, illness, melancholy and  sorrows be destroyed by the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
141

Purnabhisheka, and by the glory of the  Supreme Brahman (176). May Alakshmi, Kala−karni, the Dakinis,
and the  Yoginis, being driven away by the Kali Vija, be destroyed by the  Abhisheka (177). May the Bhuta,
Preta, Pishachas, and the maleficent  Planets be driven out, put to flight, and destroyed by the Rama Vija;  may
all misfortune caused thee by magic and by the incantations of thy  enemies, may all thy transgressions of
mind, word, and body be  destroyed as the result of this initiation; may all thy adversities be  destroyed, may
thy prosperity be undisturbed, may all thy desires be  fulfilled as the result of this Purnabhisheka (178−180).
With these twenty−one Mantras the disciple should be sprinkled with  water; and if he has obtained already
the Mantra from the mouth of a  Pashu, the Guru should make him hear it again (181).
The Kaulika Guru should, having informed the worshippers of Shakti,  call his disciple by his name and give
him a name ending with  Anandanatha (182).
Being thus initiated in the Mantra by the Guru, the disciple should  worship his Ishta−devata in the Yantra (of
the Guru), and then honour  the Guru by presenting him with the Pancha−tattvas (183).
The disciple should also give as Dakshina cows, land, gold, clothes,  drinks, and jewels to the Guru, and then
honour the Kaulas, who are the  very embodiments of Shiva (184).
The self−possessed, purified, and humble disciple, having honoured  the Kaulas, should touch the sacred feet
of the Guru with veneration,  and, bowing to him, pray to him as follows (185):
Prayer to Guru
Holy Lord! Thou art the Lord of the world. Lord! thou art my Lord.O  Ocean of Mercy! do Thou gratify my
heart's desire by the gift of the  excellent nectar (186).
The Guru should then say:
"Give me leave, O Kaulas! you who are the visible images of Shiva  Himself, that I may give to my good and
humble disciple the excellent  nectar" (187).
The Kaulas will then say:
"Lord of the Chakra! thou art the Supreme Lord Himself, Thou art the  Sun of the Kaula lotus. Do Thou
gratify this good disciple, and give  him the Kaula nectar" (188).
The Guru, having obtained the leave of the Kaulas, should place in  the hand of the disciple the drinking−cup
filled with the excellent  nectar, as also the Shuddhi (189).
The Guru should then, devoutly meditating on the Devi in his heart,  place the tilaka on the forehead of the
disciple, as also of the  Kaulas, with the ashes adhering to the sacrificial spoon (190).
Let the Guru then distribute the Tattvas offered to the Devi, and  partake of the food and drink as directed in
the injunctions relating  to the formation of Chakra (191).
O Devi! I have spoken to Thee of the auspicious rites relating to  Purnabhisheka. By this one attains divine
knowledge and becomes Shiva  Himself (192).
The Purnabhisheka should be performed for nine or seven or five or  three or one night (193).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Mantra
142

There are, O Kuleshani! five different forms in this purificatory  rite. In the rite which lasts nine nights the
Mandala known as  Sarvato−bhadra should be made (194).
Beloved! in the rite which lasts seven nights the Mandala  Nava−nabha, in the rite which lasts five nights the
Mandala Panchabja,  in the rite which lasts three nights and in the rite which lasts one  night the Mandala of
eight−petalled lotus should be respectively made  (195).
O Devi! the injunction is that on the Sarvato−bhadra and Nava−nabha  Mandalas nine jars should be placed,
on Panchabja Mandala five, and on  Ashta−dalabja Mandala one jar, and the Angga−Devatas and the
Avarana−Devatas should be worshipped in the filaments and other parts  of the lotuses (196−197).
The Kaulas who have been fully initiated are pure of soul. All  things are purified by their looking, touching,
and by their smelling  them (198). All men, whether they are Shaktas, Vaishnavas, Shaivas,  Sauras, or
Ganapatas, should worship the Kaula Sadhu with devotion  (199).
It is good for a Shakta to have a Guru who is a Shakta, for a Shaiva  a Shaiva Guru is commendable, and for a
Vaishnava a Vaishnava, for a  Saura a Saura as Guru is advised, and a Ganapata is the proper Guru for  a
Ganapata, but a Kaula is excellent as Guru in the case of all;  therefore the wise one should with all his soul be
initiated by a Kaula  (200−201). Those who worship the Kaulas with Pancha−tattva and with  heart uplifted
cause the salvation of their Ancestors, and themselves  attain the highest end (202).
The man who has obtained the Mantra from the mouth of a Pashu is of  a certainty a Pashu, and he who has
obtained the Mantra from a Vira is  a Vira, and he who obtains it from a Kaula knows the Brahman (203). One
who has been initiated according to Shakta rites is a Vira; he may  purify the Pancha−tattvas only in the
worship of his own Ishta−devata,  he may never be the Chakreshvara (204).
He who kills a Vira, he who drinks wine which has not been  consecrated, he who seduces the wife of or steals
the property of a  Vira, these four are great sinners, and the man who associates with any  of these is the fifth
sinner (205). Those evil−natured men who  disparage the Kula Way, Kula articles, and the Kula worshipper
go down  the low and vile path (206).
The Rudra−dakinis and Rudra−bhairavis dance in joy (at the thought  of) chewing the bones and flesh of men
who hate wine and the Kaulas  (207). They are merciful and truthful, and ever desire the good of  others, for
such as slander them there is no escape from Hell (208).
I have in the various Tantras spoken of various ceremonies and of  many repetitions of practices; but in the
case of a Kaula who is  devoted to the Brahman, it is a matter of indifference whether he  practises or omits
them (209).
There is one Supreme Brahman Who exists, spread throughout the  Universe (or any part of it). He is
worshipped, because there is  nothing which exists apart from Him (210).
Beloved! even those who look to the fruit of action and are governed  by their desires and by the worship of
different Devas, and addicted to  worldly pursuits, go to and become united with Him (211). He who sees
everything in Brahman, and who sees Brahman everywhere, is undoubtedly  known as an excellent Kaula,
who has attained liberation while yet  living (212).

Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
LISTENING to the injunctions of Shambhu relating to the different  castes and stages of life, Aparna was
greatly pleased, and questioned  Shangkara thus (1):
Shri Devi said:
Thou hast, O Lord! out of Thy kindness for Me and in Thy  omniscience, spoken of the customs and the rules
of religious conduct  and sacraments for the well−being of the world (2). But the men of the  Kali Age, being
wicked, and blinded by anger and lust, atheists, of  wavering minds and addicted to the gratification of their
senses, will  not in their ignorance and folly follow the way laid down by Thee; it  behoves Thee, O Ishana! to
say what will be the means of their  liberation (3−4).
Shri Sadashiva said:
Thou hast asked well, O Devi! Thou who art the Benefactress of the  world, the Mother of the world, Thou art
Durga, Thou liberatest people  from the bonds of birth and the toils of this world (5). Thou art the  Primordial
One, Thou fosterest and guardest this world, Thou art beyond  the most excellent; Thou, O Devi! supportest
the moving and the  motionless Universe (6). Thou art Earth, Thou art Water, Thou art Fire,  Thou art Air,
Thou art the Void, Thou art consciousness itself, Thou art the  mahat−tattva (7). Thou art life in this world;
Thou art the knowledge of self, and Thou art the Supreme Divinity.  Thou art the senses; Thou art the mind,
Thou art the intellect; Thou  art the motion and existence of the Universe (8).
Thou art the Vedas, Thou art the Pranava, Thou art the Smritis, the  Sanghitas, the Nigamas, the Agamas, and
the Tantras, Thou pervadest all  the Shastras, and art the Abode of all that is good (9). Thou art  Mahakali,
Mahalakshmi, Maha−nila−sarasvati, Mahodari, Mahamaya, Maharaudri,  and Maheshvari; Thou art
Omniscient and full of knowledge, there is  nothing which Thou knowest not; yet, O Wise One! since Thou
askest Me,  I will speak of it for Thy pleasure (10−11).
Thou hast truly spoken, O Devi! of the ways of men, who, knowing  what is for their welfare, yet, maddened
by sinful desire for things  which bring immediate enjoyment, and devoid of the sense of right and  wrong, will
desert the True Path. I speak now of that which will  contribute to their salvation (12−13).
In the doing of what is forbidden and in the omitting of what is  enjoined men sin, and sins lead to pain,
sorrow, and disease (14).
O Kula−nayika! know that there are two kinds of sin−− that which  contributes merely to the injury of one's
own self, and that which  causes injury to others (15). Man is released of the sin of injuring  others by the
punishment inflicted by the King, and from other sins by  expiatory rites and Samadhi (16).
Those sinful men who are not purified by either punishment or  expiation cannot but go to hell, and are
despised both in this world  and the next (17).
O Adya! I shall first of all speak of the Rules relating, O  Maheshvari! to punishment by the King. The King
who deviates from these  himself goes upon the downward path (18).
In the administration of justice, servants, sons, mendicants,  friends, and foes should all be treated alike (19).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
144

If the King is guilty of any sin himself, or if he should have  wronged one who is not guilty, then he may
purify himself by fasting  and by placating those he has wronged by gifts (20). If the King should  consider
that he is guilty of any sin which is punishable by death, he  should then abdicate his kingdom and go to a
forest, and there labour  for his liberation and penances (21). The King should not, without  sufficient reason,
inflict heavy punishment on persons guilty of a  light offence, nor should he inflict light punishment on
persons guilty  of a great offence (22). But the punishment by which many offenders may  be deterred from
ill−doing, and (punishment) in the case of an offender  who is fearless of crimes, should be heavy, although
the offence be a  light one (23).
In the case of one who has committed the offence but once only and  is ashamed of his ill−deed, or of one
who fears crime and is a  respectable man, a light punishment should be inflicted, even if the  offence be a
grave one (24).
If a Kaula or a Brahmana is guilty of a slight offence, they should  even, though highly honourable, be
punished by the King by a rebuke  (25).
The King who does not bestow adequate rewards and punishments after  consultation with his ministers is a
great sinner (26).
A son should not leave his mother and father, the subjects should  not leave their King, nor the wife her
husband, even though they are  greatly guilty (27).
The subjects should actively protect the kingdom, property, and life  of the just King; otherwise they will go
upon the downward path (28).
Shiva! those who knowingly go with their, mother, daughter, or  sister, those who have killed their
Maha−gurus, those who have, after  having taken refuge in the Kula Faith, abandoned it, and those who have
broken the trust placed in them, are great sinners (29−30).
Shiva! the punishment of those that go with their mother, sister,  and daughter is death, and if the latter are
wilful participants the  same punishment should be inflicted upon them (31).
The sinful man who with a lustful mind goes to the bed of his mother  or father's sister, or daughters−in−law,
or mothers−in−law (wife's  mother), the wife of his preceptor, the wife of his maternal or  paternal grandfather,
the daughter or wife of his mother or father's  brother, the wife or daughter of his brother, the sister's daughter,
the master's wife or daughter, or with an unmarried girl, should be  punished by castration, and these women
also if they are wilful  participants in the crime should be punished by the cutting of their  noses and turning
them out of the house that they may be released from  sin (32−34).
The punishment of the man who goes with the wife or daughter of a  sapinda, or with the wife of a man who
has trusted him, is to be  deprived of all his property and to have his head shaved (35).
If through mistake (by ignorance) one should happen to marry any of  these, either in Brahma or Shaiva form,
then she should at once be  disespoused (36).
A man who goes with the wife of another man of the same caste as  himself, or of a caste inferior to his own,
should be punished by the  imposition of a fine and by being kept on a diet of grains for one  month (37).
If a Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, or Samanya, O Thou of Beauteous  Face! goes with a Brahmana woman
knowing her to be such, then his  punishment is castration, and the Brahmana woman should be disfigured
and banished from his kingdom by the King. For such as go with the  wives of Viras, and for such wives, the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
145

punishment should be the same  (38−39).
The wicked man who enjoys the wife of one of a higher caste should  be heavily fined, and kept on a diet of
grains for three months (40).
And if the woman is a wilful party, she should be punished as above  mentioned. If the wife is the victim of a
rape, then she should be  separated from, but maintained by, her husband (41).
A wife, whether married according to Brahma or Shaiva form, should  in all cases be renounced if she has
gone with another even if it be  only once, and then whether of her own desire or against it (42).
Those who have intercourse with public women, or with cows or other  animals, should, O Deveshi! be
purified by being kept on a diet of  grains for three nights (43).
The punishment of those wicked men who have unnatural intercourse  with a woman is death; this is the
injunction of Shambhu (44).
A man who ravishes a woman, even if she be the wife of a Chandala,  should be punished by death, and
should never be pardoned (45).
A man should consider as wife only that woman who has been married  to him according to Brahma or Shaiva
form. All other women are the  wives of others (46).
A man who with lust looks at another man's wife should fast for a  day to purify himself. He who accosts her
in a secret place should fast  for two days. He who touches her should fast for four days; and he who  embraces
her should fast for eight days to purify himself (47).
And the woman who with a lustful mind behaves in the same manner  should purify herself by following the
same rules of fasting (48).
The man who uses offensive language towards a woman, who sees the  private parts of a woman who is not
his wife, and laughs derisively at  her, should fast for two days to purify himself (49).
A man who shows his naked body to another, or who makes another  person naked, should cease eating for
two days to purify himself (50).
If the husband proves that his wife has had intercourse with  another, then the King should punish her and her
paramour according to  the injunction laid down (51).
If the husband (has good cause to believe and yet) is unable to  prove the faithlessness of his wife, then he
should separate from her,  but he should maintain her if she remains under his control (52).
If the husband, on seeing his wife enjoying with her paramour, kills  her with her paramour, then the King
should not punish him with death  (53).
If the husband prohibits the wife to go to any place or to talk with  anyone, then the wife should neither go to
that place nor talk with  that person (54).
If, on the death of the husband, the widow lives with the relatives  of the husband under their control,
following the customs of a widow's  life, or in their absence she lives with the relatives of her father,  then she
deserves to inherit her husband's property (55).

The widow should not eat twice a day, nor should she eat food cooked  by one who is not her husband's
Agnate; she should renounce sexual  enjoyment, animal food, jewels, sleeping on soft beds, and coloured
clothes (56).
The widow faithful to her Dharmma should not anoint herself with  fragrant ointments, she should avoid
village gossip, and should spend  her time in the worship of the Deities and in the performance of Vratas  (57).
In the case of the boy who has neither father, mother, nor paternal  grandfather, the mother's relatives are the
best guardians (58). The  mother's mother, mother's father, mother's brother, mother's brother's  son, mother's
father's brother, these are the relatives on the mother's  side (59).
Father's mother, father, brother, father's brother's and sister's  sons, father's father's brother, are known as
paternal relatives (60).
The husband's mother, father, brother, the husband's brother's and  sister's sons, and the husband's father's
brothers, all these are known  as the relatives of the husband (61).
Ambika! the King should compel a man, according to his means, to  give food and clothes to his father,
mother, father's father, father's  mother, the wife whose son cannot support her, and to the maternal
grandfather and grandmother, who are poor and have no son (62−63).
If a man speaks rudely to his wife he must fast for a day, if he  beats her he must go without food for three
days, and if he causes her  bloodshed then he must fast for seven days (64).
If a man in his anger or folly calls his wife his mother, his  sister, or daughter, then he should purify himself
by fasting seven  days (65).
If a girl be married to an impotent man, then the King should cause  her to be married again, even if the fact is
discovered after the lapse  of some time. This is Shiva's injunction (66).
If a girl becomes a widow before consummation of marriage, she also  ought to be remarried. This also is the
command of Shiva (67).
The woman who is delivered of a child within six months of her  marriage, or after the lapse of a year
following her husband's death,  is not a wife, nor is the child legitimate (68).
The woman who causes a miscarriage before the completion of the  fifth month, as well as the person who
helps her thereto, should be  heavily punished (69).
The woman who after the fifth month destroys the child in her womb,  and the person who helps her thereto,
are guilty of killing a human  being (70).
The cruel man who wilfully kills another man should always be  sentenced to death by the King (71).
The King should correct the man who kills another man through  ignorance, or in a fit of passion, or by
mistake, either by taking his  property from him or by giving him a severe beating (72).
The man who tries to compass his own death, whether by himself or by  the aid of another, should be awarded
the same punishment as the man  who kills another through ignorance (73).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites

The man who kills another in a duel, or kills an enemy who attempts  to kill him, is not guilty of any offence
(74).
The King should punish the man who has maimed another by maiming  him, and the man who has beaten
another by having him beaten (75).
The wicked man who flings any missile, or lifts his hand to strike a  Vipra, or one who should be honoured, or
who strikes either of them,  should be punished by a pecuniary fine for the first offence, and by  the burning of
his hand for a second offence (76).
If a man dies consequent upon a wound inflicted by any weapon or  otherwise after six months, then the
offender should be punished for  the assault, and shall not be punished with death by the King (77).
If the King kills subverters of his government, men who plot to  usurp his kingdom, servants secretly
befriending the King's enemies,  men creating dissatisfaction against the King among the troops,  subjects who
wish to wage war against the King, or armed highway  robbers, he shall not be guilty of any sin (78−79).
The man who kills another, compelled by his master's order, is not  himself guilty of the killing, for it is the
master's killing. This is  the command of Shiva (80).
If a man's death is caused by a beast belonging to, or weapons in  the hand of, a careless man, then the latter
should be punished by a  pecuniary or bodily punishment (81).
Those detestable persons who disobey the King's command, who are  arrogant in their speech in the King's
presence, or who decry the Kula  faith, should be punished by the King (82).
He who misappropriates property entrusted to him, the malicious man,  the cheat, he who creates ill−feeling
between men, or who makes people  quarrel with one another, should be banished from the kingdom by the
King (83).
The King should banish from his kingdom those abandoned and  wicked−minded men who give away their
sons and daughters in marriage  for money, and who give their daughters (in marriage) to impotent  husbands
(84).
Persons who attempt to harm others by the spreading of baseless  calumnies should be punished by the just
King in accordance with their  offence (85).
The King should compel the calumniator to pay the sufferer money  commensurate with the harm done (86).
For such persons as steal gems, pearls, gold, and other metals, the  punishment should be either the cutting off
of the hand or the entire  arm, according to the value of the stolen property (87).
Those who steal buffaloes, horses, cattle, jewels, etc., and  infants, should be punished by the King as thieves
(88).
Thieves who steal food and articles of small value should be  corrected by being kept on a diet of grains for a
week or a fortnight  (89).
O Adored of the Devas! the traitor and the ingrate can never attain  liberation by sacrifices, votive
observances, penances, acts of  charity, and other expiatory rites (90).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
148

The King should, after severely punishing them, exile from his  dominion men who give false evidence, or
who are partial as arbitrators  (91).
The testimony of six, four, or even three witnesses is sufficient to  prove a fact; but, O Shiva! the testimony of
two witnesses of  well−known piety is enough (92).
Beloved! if witnesses contradict one another on questions of place,  time, and other details of fact, then their
testimony should be  rejected (93).
O Beloved! the word of the blind and the deaf should be accepted as  evidence, and the signs and writing of a
dumb man and of one who is  both deaf and dumb should also be accepted (94).
Of all evidence and in all cases, and particularly in litigation,  documentary evidence is the best, as it does not
perish and always  endures (95).
The man who fabricates a writing for his own use or for the use of  another should be punished with double
the punishment of a false  witness (96).
The statement on oath, on his own behalf, of a careful and unerring  man is of a higher probative value than
the word of many witnesses (97).
O Parvvati! as all virtues find their support in Truth, so do all  vices find their support in untruth (98).
Therefore, the King shall incur no blame by chastizing those who are  devoid of Truth and are the receptacle
of all vices. This is the  command of Shiva (99).
Devi! if a man says, "I tell the truth," at the same time touching  any of the following−− a Kaula, the Guru, a
Brahmana, water of Ganga,  an image of a Devata, a Kula religious Book, Kulamrita, or the  offerings made to
a Deity, he has taken an oath. If after that he  speaks an untruth, then he will go to hell for one Kalpa
(100−101).
An oath that an act which is not sinful will be or will not be done,  should always be kept by men (102).
The man who has broken his oath should purify himself by a  fortnight's fast; and one who has broken it by
mistake should live on  grains for twelve days (103).
Even the Kula−dharmma, if not followed according to Truth and the  injunctions, not only fails to secure final
liberation and beatitude,  but leads to sin (104).
Wine is Tara Herself in liquid form, is the Saviour of beings, the  Mother of enjoyment and liberation, who
destroys danger and diseases,  burns up the heaps of sins, and purifies the world.O Beloved! She  grants all
success, and increases knowledge, intellect, and learning,  and, O Adya! She is ever worshipped by those who
have attained final  liberation and those who are desirous of attaining final liberation, by  those that have
become and those striving to be adepts, and by Kings  and Devas for the attainment of their desires (105−107).
Mortals who drink wine with their minds well under control and  according to the injunctions (of Shiva) are,
as it were, Immortals on  earth (108).
By partaking, in accordance to the injunctions, of any of the  tattvas, man becomes like unto Shiva. What,
then, is the result of  partaking of all the five Tattvas? (109).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
149

But the drinking of this Devi Varuni in disregard of the injunctions  destroys the intellect (understanding), life,
fame, and wealth of men  (110).
By the excessive drinking of wine the drunkard destroys the  understanding, which is the means for the
attainment of the fourfold  end of human existence (111).
Only harm at every step, both to himself and to others, comes out of  a man whose mind is distracted and who
knows not what should and what  should not be done (112).
Therefore, the King or the Lord of the Chakra should correct by  bodily and pecuniary punishments those who
are over−addicted to wine  and intoxicating drugs (113).
The understanding of men is clouded by the drinking of wine, whether  in small or large quantities, according
to the difference in the  quality of the wine, to the temperament of the individuals, to the  place where and the
time when it is taken (114).
Therefore, excessive drinking is to be judged, not from the quantity  drunk, but from the result as shown in
difficulty of speech and from  the unsteadiness of hands, feet, and sight (115).
The King should burn the tongues and confiscate the money of, and  inflict corporal punishments on, men
who hold not their senses under  control, whose minds are distracted by drink, who deviate from the duty  they
owe to Devas and Gurus, who are fearful to behold, who are the  source of all folly, who are sinful, and
transgressors of the  injunctions of Shiva, and bring ruin on themselves (116−117).
The King should severely chastise and fine the man who is unsteady  in hands, feet, or in speech, who is
bewildered, maddened, and beyond  himself with drink (118).
The King, who labours for the happiness of his subjects, should  inflict pecuniary punishment on the drunkard
who is guilty of evil  language and is devoid of fear and shame (119).
O Kuleshvari! a Kaula, even if he has been initiated a hundred  times, should be regarded as a Pashu, and
expelled from the Kula  community (120).
The Kaula who drinks excessively of wine, be it consecrated or not,  should be renounced by all Kaulas and
punished by the King (121).
The drunken twice−born man who makes his Brahmi wife drink wine  should purify both himself and his wife
by living on a diet of grains  for five days (122).
The man who has drunk wine which has not been sanctified should  purify himself by fasting for three days,
and who has eaten meat which  has not been sanctified should fast for two days (123).
If a man partakes of fish and parched food which have not been  sanctified, he should fast for a day, but who
participates in the fifth  tattva without conforming to the rites should be corrected by the  King's punishment
(124).
He who knowingly eats human flesh or beef should purify himself by a  fortnight's fast. This is the expiation
for this sin (125).
Beloved! a man who has eaten the flesh of animals of human shape, or  of carnivorous animals, should purify
himself by a three days' fast  (126).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
150

The man who partakes of food cooked by Mlechchhas, Chandalas, and  Pashus, who are the enemies of the
Kula creed, is purified by a  fortnight's fast (127).
And, O Kuleshvari! if anyone knowingly partakes of the leavings of  these, then he should fast for a month to
purify himself, and if he has  done so unknowingly he should fast for a fortnight (128).
The injunction is that if a man partakes of food cooked by a man of  a caste inferior to his own, he should, to
purify himself, fast for  three days (129).
By the partaking of food of a Pashu, Chandala, and Mlechchha, which  has been placed in the Chakra or in the
hands of a Vira, no sin is  incurred (130).
One who partakes of forbidden food at a time when food is scarce, in  times of famine and danger, or when
life is at stake, is guiltless of  any transgression (131).
If food is eaten on the back of an elephant, or on a block of stone,  or on a piece of wood, which can be carried
only by several men, or in  places where nothing objectionable is actually perceived, there is no  fault (132).
Animals the flesh of which is forbidden, as also diseased animals,  should not be killed even for the purpose of
sacrifice to the Devas. By  killing such animals sin is incurred (133).
If anyone knowingly kills a bull, then he shall do penance (as  described below), and if he does so
unknowingly he shall do half of  such penance. This is the command of Shangkara (134).
So long as the penance is not performed he shall not shave or pare  his nails nor wear clean raiments (135).
Shiva! he should fast for a month, and should live on grains for  another month, and should live eating food
which he has begged during  the third month. This is called Krichchhra−Vrata  (136).
At the end of the penance he should shave his head and free himself  from the sin of wilful killing of the bull
by feasting Kaulas,  relatives (Agnates), and Bandhavas (137).
If the death of a cow or bull is caused by want of care, the  expiation is an eight days' fast for a Brahmana, and
for a Kshatriya or  inferior castes fasting for six, four, and two days (138).
O Kaulini! the sin of wilfully slaughtering an elephant or a camel,  or a buffalo, or a horse is expiated by a
three days' fast (139).
Expiation for killing a deer, sheep, goat, or a cat, is a fast for  one whole day and a night, and one who has
killed a peacock, a parrot,  or a gander should abstain fom food till sunset of the day on which the  sin is
committed (140).
If anyone kills any other inferior animal which possesses bones, he  should live on vegetable food for a night.
The killing of a boneless  animal is expiated by repentance (141).
There is no blame upon Kings who kill beasts, fish, and oviparous  creatures when hunting; for hunting, O
Devi! is an immemorial practice  among Kings (142).
Killing should always be avoided, O Gentle One! except if it be for  the purpose of sacrifice to a Deva. The
man who kills according to the  injunctions sins not (143).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
151

Should a man be unable to complete a religious devotion which he has  undertaken, if he walks across the
remnants after the worship of any  Devata, or if he touches an image of a Deva when he is unclean, then in  all
such cases he should recite the Gayatri (144).
The father, the mother, and the giver of the Brahman are the  Maha−gurus. He who speaks ill of, or towards,
them should, in order to  purify himself, fast for five days (145).
Similarly, O Beloved! if anyone speaks ill of other persons entitled  to respect, Kaulas and Vipras, then he
should purify himself by fasting  two days and a half (146).
A man may for the acquisition of wealth go to any country, but he  should avoid such countries and Shastras
as prohibit Kaulika rites  (147).
The man who of his own free−will goes to a country where the  Kaula−dharmma is prohibited falls from his
status, and should be  purified by Purnabhisheka (148).
In expiatory penance, that which is recognized as a fast is going  without food for eight yamas from sunrise
(149).
The fast is, however, not broken should one drink a handful of water  or eat the air for the preservation of his
life (150).
If one is unable, by reason of old age or disease, to fast, then, in  lieu of each fast, he should feast twelve
Brahmanas (151).
The sins of speaking ill of others, self−laudation, evil habits,  impropriety in speech or action, should be
expiated by repentance (152).
All other sins, whether committed knowingly or unknowingly, are  destroyed by repeating the Gayatri of the
Devi and feeding the Kaulas  (153).
These general rules are applicable to men, women, and the sexless;  the only difference is that in the case of
the women the husband is  their Maha−guru (154).
Men who are suffering from very great disease and those who are  always ailing become purified and entitled
to perform rites relating to  the Devas and the Pitris by giving away gold (155).
A house which has been defiled by unnatural death, or which has been  struck by lightning, should be purified
by one hundred Vyahriti Homas  (156).
If the dead body of an animal possessing bones be found in a lake,  tank, or well, then it should be at once
taken out, and the same should  be purified (157).
The method of purifying such places is as follows: Twenty−one jars  of pure water should, after being
consecrated with Purnabhisheka  Mantra, be poured into it (158).
If such places contain but a small quantity of water, and this has  been polluted by the stench of the dead body,
then they should be  dewatered and the loose mud removed therefrom, and when this has been  done water
should be poured in the manner described (159).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 11 −  The Account of  Expiatory Rites
152

If they contain water of sufficient quantity to drown an elephant,  then a hundred jars of water should be
removed, and then consecrated  water should be poured into them (160).
If not so purified, then the waters of the reservoirs polluted by  the touch of the dead body become
undrinkable, and the reservoir cannot  be consecrated (161).
Bathing in these reservoirs is useless, and any rite performed with  their waters becomes fruitless, and any
person using the water for any  purpose whatever should remain without food for a day and take  Panchamrita
to purify himself (162).
Should anyone perchance see a wealthy man who begs, a warrior averse  to battle, a detractor of the Kula
dharmma, a lady of the family who  drinks wine, a man who is a traitor, or a learned man addicted to sin,  then
in any of these cases he should view the Sun, utter the name of  Vishnu, and bathe in the clothes which he is
wearing at the time  (163−164).
Men of the twice−born classes should, if they sell donkeys, fowls,  or swine, or if they engage in any low
pursuits, purify themselves by  observing the three days' vrata (165).
The Tri−dina−vrata, O Ambika! is thus performed: the first day is to  be spent in fasting, the second day is to
be spent in eating grain  meals only, and the third in drinking water only (166).
The man who, without being asked, enters a room the door of which is  closed, and one who speaks of things
which he has been asked to keep  secret, should go without food for five days (167).
The man who from pride fails to rise when he sees anyone worthy of  veneration coming towards him, or
when he sees the Kula Scriptures  being brought in, should go without food for a day in order to purify
himself (168).
In this Shastra spoken by Shiva the meanings of the words used are  plain; those who put far−fetched
meanings upon them go the downward  path (169).
I have spoken to thee, O Devi! of that which is the Essence of  essences, of that which is above the most
excellent, of that which  conduces to the well−being (of men) in this worId and the next, as also  of that which
is both purifying and beneficent and according to Dharmma  (170).

Chapter 12 − An Account of the  Eternal and Immutable
Dharmma
SHRI SADASHIVA said:
O Primordial One! I am speaking to Thee again of the everlasting  laws; the wise King may easily rule his
subjects if he follows them (1).
If Kings did not establish rules, men in their covetousness would  quarrel among themselves, even with their
friends, relatives, and their  superiors (2).
These self−seeking men, O Devi! would for the sake of wealth kill  one another, and be full of sin by reason
of their maliciousness and  desire to thieve (3).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 12 − An Account of the  Eternal and Immutable Dharmma
153

It is therefore for their good that I am laying down the rule in  accordance with Dharmma, by following which
men will not swerve from  the right (path) (4).
As the King should punish the wicked for the removal of their sins,  so should he also divide the inheritance
according to the relationship  (5).
Relationship is of two kinds−−by marriage and by birth; of these,  relationship by birth is stronger than
relationship by marriage (6).
In inheritance, O Shiva! descendants have a stronger claim than  ascendants, and in this order of descendants
and ascendants the males  are better qualified for inheritance than females (7).
But among these, again, the proximate relation is entitled to the  inheritance; the wise ones should divide the
property according to this  rule and in this order (8):
If the deceased leaves son, grandson, daughters, father, wife, and  other relations, then the son is entitled to the
whole of the  inheritance, and not the others (9).
If there are several sons, they are all entitled to equal shares.  (In the case of a King) the kingdom goes to the
eldest son, but that is  in accordance to the custom of the family (10).
If there be any paternal debt which should be paid out of the  paternal property, such property should not be
divided (11).
If men should divide and take paternal property, then the King  should take it from them, and discharge the
paternal debt (12).
As men go to hell by reason of their own sins, so they are bound by  their individually incurred debts, and
others are not (13).
Whatever general property there may be, either immovable or of other  kinds, sharers shall get the same
according to their respective shares  (14).
The division is complete on the co−partners agreeing to it. If they  do not agree, then the King should divide it
impartially (15).
The King should divide the value or profits of property which is  incapable of division, whether the same be
immovable or movable (16).
If a man proves his right to a share after the property is divided,  then the King should divide the property over
again, and give the  person entitled his share (17).
O Shiva! the King should punish the man who, after property is once  divided by the consent of the
co−partners, quarrels again with respect  to it (18).
If the deceased dies leaving behind him grandson, wife, and father,  then the grandson is entitled to the
property by reason of his being a  descendant (19).
If the childless man leaves (surviving him) father, brother, and  grandfather, then the father inherits the
property by reason of the  closeness of consanguinity (20).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 12 − An Account of the  Eternal and Immutable Dharmma
154

Beloved! if the deceased leaves daughters (surviving him), although  they are closer to him, yet the grandsons
(sons' sons) are entitled to  his property, because man is prior (21).
From the grandfather the property goes to the grandson by the  deceased son, and thus it is that men proclaim
that the father's self  is in the image of the son (22).
In marital relationship the Brahmi wife is the superior, and the  sonless man's property should go to the wife,
who is half his body (23).
The sonless widow, however, is not competent to sell or give away  property inherited from her husband,
except what is her own by her own  right (24).
Anything given by the fathers and fathers−in−law approved by  Dharmma, whatever is earned by her personal
efforts, is to be  recognized as "Woman's property" (25).
On her death it goes to the husband, and to his heirs according to  the grades of descendants and ancestors (26).
If the woman remains faithful to her Dharmma, and lives under the  control of the relations of her husband,
and in their absence under the  control of her father's relations, then only is she entitled to inherit  (27).
The woman who is even likely to go astray is not entitled to inherit  the husband's property. She is merely
entitled to a living allowance  from the heirs of her husband (28).
If the man who has died has many wives, all of whom are pious, then,  O Thou of pure Smiles! they are
entitled to the husband's property in  equal shares (29).
If the woman who inherits her husband's property dies leaving  daughters, then the property is taken to have
gone back from the  husband and from him to the daughter (30).
In this way, if there is a daughter and the property goes to the  son's widow, then, on the death of the latter, it
would go back to the  husband, and from the father−in−law descend to the daughter of the  latter (31).
Similarly, O Shiva! if property goes to the mother in the lifetime  of the paternal grandfather, then, on her
death, it goes to her  father−in−law through her son and husband (32).
As the property of the deceased ascends to the father, so it also  ascends to the mother if she is a widow (33).
But the stepmother shall not inherit if the mother is living, but on  the death of the mother it goes to the
stepmother through the father  (34).
Where, in the absence of descendants, the inheritance cannot  descend, it would ascend the same way by
which it would descend (35).
Therefore, even when the father's brother is alive, the daughter  inherits the property, and if she dies childless
then such property  goes to the father's brother (36).
As inheritance descends in the male line, the stepbrother inherits  even when there is a uterine sister (37).
And when there is a uterine sister and sons of stepbrother, it is  the latter who inherit the property (38).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 12 − An Account of the  Eternal and Immutable Dharmma
155

If the deceased leaves (surviving him) both uterine and stepbrother,  then, by reason of the property
descending through the father, they are  entitled to inherit in equal shares (39).
In the lifetime of their daughters their sons are not entitled to  inherit until the obstruction is removed by the
death of the daughters  (40).
In the absence of sons, the daughters divide among themselves the  paternal property, after deducting the
marriage expenses of an  unmarried daughter (if any) out of the general estate (41).
On the death of a childless woman the stri−dhana goes to her  husband, and the property which she inherited
from anyone else goes  back to the line of the person from whom she inherited (42).
The woman may spend property inherited by her on her own  maintenance, and she may spend profits of it on
acts of religious  merit, but she is not able to sell or make gifts of it (43).
Where the daughter−in−law of the grandfather (father's father) is  living, or the stepmother of the father is
living, the inheritance goes  to the grandfather, and through his son to the (grandfather's)  daughter−in−law
(44).
Where the grandfather, the father's brother, and the brother are  living, the brother succeeds by reason of the
priority in claim of the  descendant (45).
If a man dies leaving him surviving his grandfather, brother, and  uncle, both of the former are nearer in
degree−− than the last, and the  property descends through the father to the deceased's brother (46).
If the deceased leaves a daughter's son and father (surviving him),  then the daughter's son inherits, because
property in the first place  descends (47).
If both the father and the mother of the deceased be living (at his  death), then, O Kalika! by reason of the
superior claim of the male,  the father takes his property (48).
If the mother's brother is living, the sapindas of the father take  the property of the deceased by reason of the
superior claim of the  paternal relationship (49).
Property failing to go downwards has (here) gone upwards, but, O  Shiva! by reason of the superior claim of
the male line it has gone to  the father's family. The mother's brother, in spite of the nearness of  his
relationship, does not inherit (50).
The grandson by a deceased son inherits from his grandfather's  estate the share which his father would have
inherited along with his  (the father's) brothers (51).
Similarly, the granddaughter who has no brother and whose parents  are dead, inherits, if she be well
conducted, her grandfather's  (father's father) property with her father's brothers (52).
On the death of the grandfather leaving him surviving his wife, his  daughter, and granddaughter, the last, O
Devi! is the heiress of the  property, since she takes it through her father (53).
In property which descends the male among the descendants, and in  property which ascends, the male among
the ascendants, are  pre−eminently qualified (to inherit) (54).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 12 − An Account of the  Eternal and Immutable Dharmma
156

Therefore, O Beloved! if the deceased has daughter−in−law,  granddaughter, and daughter surviving him, then
his father cannot take  the property (55).
If there is no one in the family of the father of the deceased  entitled to inherit his property, then in manner
above indicated it  goes to the family of his mother's father (56).
Property which has gone to the maternal grandfather shall ascend and  descend, and go both to males and
females through the maternal uncle  and his sons and others (57).
If the line of Brahmi marriage, or if the sapindas of the father or  of the mother, be in existence, then the issue
of the Shaiva marriage  are not entitled to inherit the father's property (58).
The wife and children of the Shaiva marriage, O Gentle One! are  entitled to receive, from the person who
inherits the property of the  deceased, their food and clothes in proportion to the property left  (59).Beloved!
the Shaiva wife, if well conducted, is entitled to be  maintained by the Shaiva husband alone. She has no claim
to the  property of her father and others (60).
Therefore, the father who marries his well−born daughter according  to Shaiva rites by reason of anger or
covetousness will be despised of  men (61).
In the absence of issue of the Shaiva marriage, the Sodaka, the  Guru, and the King shall, by the injunctions of
Shiva, take the  property of the deceased (62).
Beloved! men within the seventh degree are sapindas, and beyond them  to the seventh degree are sodakas,
and beyond them are Gotra−jas merely  (63).
Where property which has been divided is again wilfully mixed  together, it should be divided again as if it
had not been divided (64).
The heirs of a deceased are on his death entitled to such share of  property, whether partitioned or not
partitioned, as the deceased  himself was entitled to (65).
Those who inherit the property of another should offer him pindas as  long as they live; it is otherwise in the
case of a son by Shaiva  marriage (66).
Just as the rules relating to uncleanliness should, in this world,  be observed by reason of birth−connection, so
they should be observed  for three nights by reason of connection by heirship (67).
The twice−born and other classes shall purify themselves by  observing the rules as to uncleanliness from the
day they hear the  cause of it until the end of the period prescribed; this is so both in  the case of Purnashaucha
and of Khandashaucha (68).
If the period has expired when one hears the cause of it, then there  is no Khandashaucha. And as regards
Purnashaucha, it should be observed  for only three days, but if one hears of the cause of the uncleanliness
after the lapse of a year there is no period of uncleanliness to be  observed (69).
If a son hears of his father's or mother's death, or if the faithful  wife hears of her husband's death after one
year, then the son or the  widow shall observe the period of uncleanliness for three nights (71).
If during the continuance of a period of uncleanliness another new  period begins, then the period comes to an
end with the end of the  Garu−ashaucha (71).

The degree of different kinds of uncleanliness depends on the  greater or lesser length of the period which
should be observed. Of the  various kinds of uncleanliness, that which is extensive in point of  time is greater
than that which is less extensive (72).
If on the last day of a period of uncleanliness another period  commences, then the uncleanliness is removed
on the last day of the  first period of uncleanliness; but if the cause of uncleanliness be  such as to necessitate
the observance of the full period, then the  pre−existing period should be extended by two days (73).
The unmarried female shall observe the period of uncleanliness of  the father's family, but after she is married
she is to observe  impurity for three days on the death of her parents (74).
After her marriage the wife becomes of the same gotra as her  husband; the adopted son similarly becomes of
the same gotra as the  person who adopts him (75).
A son should be adopted with consent of his father and mother, and  at the time of adoption the adopted
should, with his kinsmen, perform  the sacramental rites, mentioning his own gotra and name (76).
The adopted son shall have the same right to the property of his  adoptive mother and father, and the same
rights to offer pindas to them  as the natural−born son has, since they are his mother and father (77).
A boy of less than five years of age and of one's own caste should  be adopted and brought up; a boy of over
five years of age is not  eligible (78).
O Kalika! if a brother adopts his brother's son, then the brother  adopting becomes the father, and the natural
father becomes the uncle  of the boy so adopted (79).
He who inherits the property of another should observe the Dharmma  of the person he inherits; he should also
follow his family custom and  please his kinsmen (80).
In the case of the death of kaninas, golakas, kundas, and persons  guilty of great sins, there is no uncleanliness
to be observed, and  they are not qualified to inherit (81).
In the case of the death of a man who has been punished by  castration, or of a woman who has been punished
by the cutting of her  nose, or of persons guilty of very great sins, there is no period of  uncleanliness to be
observed (82).
The King should for twelve years protect the family and property of  those of whom no news is known, and
who have disappeared without any  trace of their whereabouts (83).
On the expiration of twelve years the image of such a person should  be made with kusha grass and cremated.
His children and others should  observe a period of uncleanliness for three days, and liberate him from  the
condition of a Preta (84).
The King should then divide his property among the members of his  family in their order, beginning with the
son; otherwise he (the King)  incurs sin (85).
The King should protect the man who has no protector, who is  powerless, who is in the midst of adversity,
because the King is the  Lord of his subjects (86).
Kalika! if the man who has disappeared returns after the lapse of  twelve years, then he shall recover his wife,
children, and property;  there is no doubt of that (87).

Even a man is not competent to give away ancestral, immovable  property, either to his own people or to
strangers, without the consent  of his heirs (88).
A man may, at his pleasure, give away self−acquired property, be it  movable or immovable, and may also
give away ancestral movable property  (89).
If there be a son or wife living, or daughter or daughter's son, or  father or mother, or brother or sister, even
then one may give away  self−acquired property, both movable and immovable, and inherited  movable
property (90−91).
If a man gives away or dedicates such property to any religious  object, then his sons and others cannot affect
such gift or dedication  (92).
Property dedicated to any religious object should be looked after by  the giver. The latter is, however, not
competent to take it back,  because the ownership of such property is Dharmma (93).
Ambika! the property or the profits thereof should be employed by  the dedicator himself, or his agent, for the
religious object to which  it was dedicated (94).
If the proprietor out of affection gives away half his self−acquired  property to anyone, then his heirs shall not
be able to annul the gift  (95).
If the proprietor gives half his self−acquired wealth to any of his  heirs, in such a case the other heirs shall not
be able to avoid such  gift (96).
If one of several brothers earns money with the help of the paternal  property, then, while the other brothers
are entitled to proportionate  shares of the paternal property, no one but the acquirer is entitled to  the profits
(97).
If one brother acquires ancestral property which was lost, then he  shall receive two shares, and the other
brothers shall together receive  one share (98).
Religious merit, wealth, and learning are all dependent on the body,  and inasmuch as this body comes from
the father, then (in such sense)  what is there which is not paternal property? (99).
If whatever men earn, even when separate in mess and separate in  property, is to be considered paternal
property, then what is there  that is self−acquired? (100).
Therefore, O Great Devi! whatever money is earned by one's own  individual labour shall be self−acquired;
the person acquiring it shall  be the owner thereof, and no one else (101).
O Devi! the man who even lifts his hand against his mother, father,  Guru, paternal and maternal grandfathers,
shall not inherit (102).
The man who kills another shall not inherit his property; but the  other heirs of the person killed shall inherit
his property (103).
Ambika! eunuchs and persons who are crippled are entitled to food  and clothes so long as they live, but they
are not entitled to inherit  property (104).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 12 − An Account of the  Eternal and Immutable Dharmma
159

If a man finds property which belongs to another, on the road or  anywhere else, then the King shall, after due
deliberation, make the  finder restore it to the owner (105).
If a man finds property, or a beast of which there is no owner, then  the finder becomes the owner of the same,
but should give the King a  tenth share of such property or beast (or of the value thereof) (106).
If there be a competent buyer for immovable property, who is a near  relation, then it is not competent for the
owner of the immovable  property to sell the same to another (107).
Among buyers who are near, the agnate and one of the same caste are  specially qualified, and in their absence
friends, but the desire of  the seller should prevail (108).
If immovable property is about to be sold at a price fixed, and a  neighbour pays the same price, then the latter
is entitled to purchase  it and no other (109).
If the neighbour is unable to pay the price and consents to the sale  (to another), then only may the
householder sell the property to  another (110).
O Devi! if immovable property be bought without the knowledge of the  neighbour, the latter is entitled to
have it upon the condition of his  paying the price immediately he hears of such sale (111).
Should, however, the buyer, after purchasing it, have converted the  place into a garden, or built a house
thereon, or if he has pulled down  any building, the neighbour is not entitled in such a case to obtain  the
immovable property by the payment of its price (112).
A man may, without permission, without payment, and without  obstruction, bring under cultivation any land
which rises from the  water, which is in the middle of a forest, or otherwise difficult of  access (113).
Where land has been brought under cultivation by considerable  labour, the King, since he is the Lord of the
soil, should be given a  tenth of the profits of the land, and the rest should be enjoyed by him  who has
reclaimed it (114).
One should not excavate tanks, reservoirs, or wells, nor plant  trees, nor build houses in places where they are
likely to injure other  people (115).
All have the right to drink the water of tanks and wells dedicated  to Devas, as also the water of rivers, but the
neighbours alone have  the right to bale it out (116).
The water should not be baled out of tanks, etc., even by  neighbours, if to do so would cause a water famine
(117).
The mortgage and sale of property which is undivided without the  consent of the co−sharers, as also when the
right of the parties  therein is not determined, is invalid (118).
If property mortgaged or deposited with another is destroyed  wilfully or by negligence, then the King should
make the mortgagee or  depositee restore the value thereof to the owner (119).
If any animal or any other thing is used with the consent of the  depositor by the person with whom they are
placed, then the depositee  should bear the expense of food and keep (120).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 12 − An Account of the  Eternal and Immutable Dharmma
160

Where immovable or movable property is made over to another for  profit, such transaction will be invalid if it
be not for a definite  time, or if the amount of profits is indeterminate (121).
Common (joint) property should not, on the father's death, be  employed for profit without the consent of all
the co−sharers (122).
If articles are sold at improper prices, then the King may set aside  such sale (123).
As a body is born and dies only once, and property can be given away  only once, so there can be but one
Brahma marriage of the daughter  (124).
The man, devoted to his ancestors, who has an only son, should not  give him away (in adoption), and,
similarly, he should not give away an  only wife or an only daughter in Shaiva marriage (125).
In rites relating to the Devas and the Pitris, in mercantile  transactions, and in Courts of law, whatever the
substitute (Agent)  does is the act of the employer (126).
The immutable rule is that the Agent or emissary should not be  punished for the guilt of the employer (127).
In monetary dealings, in agriculture, in mercantile transactions, as  also in all other dealings, whatever is
undertaken, the same should be  performed if in agreement with Dharmma (128).
The Lord protects this universe. Whoever wish to destroy it will be  themselves destroyed, and whosoever
protect it them the Lord of the  Universe Himself protects. Therefore should one act for the good of the  world
(129).

Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
PARVATI, the Mother of the three worlds, Her mind engrossed with  thoughts for the purification of men
polluted with the impurities of  the Kali Age, humbly asked Mahesha, the Deva among Devas, who had thus
spoken of the essence of all the Nigamas, which is the seed of heaven  and final liberation (as follows) (1):
Shri Devi said:
How should the form of Mahakali be thought of, She who is the Great  Cause, the Primordial Energy, the
Great Effulgence, more subtle than  the subtlest elements? (2).
It is only that which is the work of Prakriti which has form. How  should She have form? She is above the
most high. It behoves thee, O  Deva! to completely remove this doubt of mine (3).
Shri Sadashiva said:
Beloved! I have already said that to meet the needsof the  worshippers the image of the Devi is formed
according to Her qualities  and actions (4).
As white, yellow, and other colours all disappear in black, in the  same way, O Shailaja! all beings enter Kali
(5).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
161

Therefore it is that by those who have attained the knowledge of the  means of final liberation, the
attributeless, formless, and beneficent  Kalashakti is endowed with the colour of blackness (6).
As the eternal and inexhaustible One image of Kala and soul of  beneficence is nectar itself, therefore the sign
of the Moon is placed  on her forehead (7). As She surveys the entire universe, which is the  product of time,
with Her three eyes−− the Moon, the Sun, and Fire−−  therefore she is endowed with three eyes (8).
As She devours all existence, as She chews all things existing with  her fierce teeth, therefore a mass of blood
is imagined to be the  apparel of the Queen of the Devas (at the final dissolution) (9).
As time after time She protects all beings from danger, and as She  directs them in the paths of duty, her hands
are lifted up to dispel  fear and grant blessings (10).
As She encompasses the universe, which is the product of Rajoguna,  she is spoken of, O Gentle One! as the
Devi who is seated on the red  lotus, gazing at Kala drunk with intoxicating wine and playing with the
universe. The Devi also, whose substance is intelligence, witnesseth  all things (11−12).
It is for the benefit of such worshippers as are of weak  intelligence that the different shapes are formed
according to the  attributes (of the Divinity) (13).
Shri Devi said:
What merit does the worshipper gain who makes an image of the Great  Devi of mud, stone, wood, or metal,
in accordance with the  representation described by Thee for the salvation of humanity, and who  decks the
same with clothes and jewels, and who, in a beautifully  decorated house, consecrates it? (14−15).
O Lord! out of Thy kindness for me, reveal this also, with all the  particular rules according to which the
image of the Devi should be  consecrated (16).
Thou hast already spoken of the consecration of Tanks, Wells,  Houses, Gardens, and the images of Devas,
but Thou didst not speak in  detail (17).
I wish to hear the injunctions relating to them from thy  lotus−mouth. Out of thy kindness, speak, O
Para−meshana! if it pleases  Thee (18).
Shri Sadashiva said:
O Parameshvari! this supreme essence about which Thou hast asked is  very mysterious. Do thou, therefore,
listen attentively (19).
There are two classes of men−− those who act with, and without, a  view to the fruits of action. The latter
attain final liberation. I am  now speaking of the former (20).
Beloved! the man who consecrates the image of a Deva goes to the  region of such Deva, and enjoys that
which is there attainable (21).
He who consecrates an image of mud stays in such region for ten  thousand kalpas. He who consecrates an
image of wood stays there ten  times that period. In the case of the consecration of a stone image the  length of
stay is ten times the latter period, and in the case of the  consecration of a metal image it is ten times the
last−mentioned period  (22).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

Listen to the merit which is acquired by the man who, in the name of  any Deva, or for the attainment of any
desire, builds and consecrates  and gives away a temple made of timber and thatch and other materials,  or
renovates such a temple, decorated with flags and images of the  carriers of the Deva (23).
He who gives away a thatched temple shall live in the region of the  Devas for one thousand koti years (24).
He who gives away a brick−built temple shall live a hundred times  that period, and he who gives away a
stone−built temple, ten thousand  times the last−mentioned period (25).
Adya! the man who builds a bridge or causeway shall not see the  region of Yama, but will happily reach the
abode of the Suras, and will  there have enjoyment in their company (26).
He who dedicates trees and gardens goes to the region of the Devas,  and lives in celestial houses surrounded
by Kalpa trees in the  enjoyment of all desired and agreeable enjoyments (27).
Those who give away ponds and the like for the comfort of all beings  are washed of all sins, and, having
attained the blissful region of  Brahma, reside there a hundred years for each drop of water which they  contain
(28).
Devi! the man who dedicates the image of a Vahana for the pleasure  of any Deva shall live continually in the
region of such Deva,  protected by Him (29).
Ten times the merit which is acquired on earth by the gift of a  Vahana made of mud is acquired by the gift of
one made of wood, and ten  times the latter is acquired by the gift of one made of stone. Should  one made of
brass or bell−metal or copper, or any other metal, be  given, then the merit is multiplied in each case tenfold
(30−31).
The excellent worshipper should present a great lion to the temple  of Devi, a bull to the temple of Shangkara,
and a Garuda to the temple  of Keshava (32).
The geat lion has sharp teeth, a ferocious mouth, and mane on his  neck and shoulder. The claws of his four
feet are as hard as the  thunderbolt (33).
The bull is armed with horns, is white of body, and has four black  hoofs, a large hump, black hair at the end
of his tail, and a black  shoulder (34).
The Garuda is winged, has thighs like a bird, and a face like a  man's, with a long nose. He is seated on his
haunches, with folded  palms (35).
By the present of flags and flag−staffs the Devas remain pleased for  a hundred years. The flag−staff should
be thirty−two cubits long (36),  and should be strong, without defects, straight, and pleasant to look  at. It
should be wrapped round with a red cloth, with a chakra at its  top (37) 
The flag should be attached to the top of the staff, and should be  marked with the image of the carrier of the
particular Devata. It  should be broad at the part nearest the staff and narrow at the other  end. It should be
made of fine cloth. In short, whatever ornaments the  top of the flag−staff is a flag (38).
Whatever a man presents with faith and devotion in the name of a  Deva, be it clothes, jewels, beds, carriages,
vessels for drinking and  eating, pan plates, spittoon, precious stones, pearl, coral, gems, or  anything else with
which he is pleased, such a man will reach the  region of such Deva and receive in turn a Koti times the
presents he  made (39−40).

Those who worship with the object of attaining a particular reward  gain such reward which (however) is as
destructible as a kingdom  acquired in a dream. Those, however, who rightly act without hope of  reward attain
nirvana, and are released from rebirth (41).
In ceremonies relating to the dedication of a reservoir of water, a  house, a garden, a bridge, a causeway, a
Devati, or a tree, the Vastu  Spirit should be carefully worshipped (42).
The man who performs any of these ceremonies without worshipping the  Vastu−Daitya is troubled by the
Vastu−Daitya and his followers (43).
The twelve followers of the Vastu Daitya are Kapi−lasya, Pingakesha,  Bhishana, Raktalochana,
Kotara−raksha, Lambakarna, Dirghajanggha,  Mahodara, Ashvatunda, Kakakantha, Vajravahu, and
Vratantaka, and these  followers of Vastu should be propitiated with great care (44−45).
Now, listen! I am speaking of the Mandala where the Vastu−Purusha  should be worshipped (36).
On an altar or on a level space, which has been well washed with  pure water, a straight line should be drawn,
one cubit in length, from  the Vayu to the Ishana corner.
In the same manner another line should be drawn from the Ishana to  the Agni corner, and another from the
Agni to the Nairita corner, and  then from the Nairita to the Vayu corner (47−48).
By these straight lines a square mandala should be drawn (49). Then  two lines should be drawn from corner
to corner (diagonally) to divide  the mandala into four parts, like four fish−tails (50).
The wise man should then draw two lines, one from the West to the  East, and the other from the North to the
South, through the point  where the diagonal lines cut one another, so as to pass through the tip  of the
fish−tails (51).
Then four diagonal lines should be drawn connecting the corners of  the four inner squares so formed by the
lines at each of the corners  (52).
According to these rules, sixteen rooms should be drawn with five  different colours, and an excellent yantra
thus made (53).
In the four middle rooms draw a beautiful lotus with four petals,  the pericarp of yellow and red colour, and
the filaments of red (54).
The petals may be white or yellow, and the interstices may be  coloured with any colour chosen (55).
Beginning with the corner of Shambhu, the twelve rooms should be  filled up with the four colours−− viz.,
white, black, yellow, and red  (56).
In filling up the rooms one should go towards one's right, and in  the worship of the Devas therein one should
go to the left (57).
The Vastu Spirit should be worshipped in the lotus, and the twelve  daityas, Kapilasya and others, should be
worshipped in the twelve  rooms, beginning with the Ishana corner (58).
Fire should be consecrated according to the injunctions laid down  for Kushandika, and after offer of oblations
to the best of one's  ability, the Vastu−yajna should be concluded (59).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
164

I have thus described, O Devi! the auspicious Vastu worship, by the  performance of which a man never
suffers dangers from Vastu (and his  followers) (60).
Shri Devi said:
Thou hast described the mandala of, and the injunctions relating to,  the worship of Vastu, but thou hast not
spoken of the Dhyana, my  husband; do thou now reveal it (61).
Shri Sadashiva said:
I am speaking of Dhyana of the Vastu−Rakshasa, by constant and  devoted repetition of which all dangers are
destroyed. O Maheshani! do  thou listen (62).
The Deva Vastu−pati should be meditated upon as four−armed, of great  body, his head covered with matted
hair, three eyed, of ferocious  aspect, decked with garlands and earrings, with big belly and long ears  and
hairy body, wearing yellow garments, holding in his hand the mace,  the trident, the axe, and the Khatvanga.
Let him be pictured as (red)  like the rising Sun and like the God of Death to one's enemies, seated  in the
padmasana posture on the back of a tortoise, surrounded by  Kapilasya and other powerful followers, carrying
swords and shields  (63−66).
Whenever there is panic caused by pestilence or epidemics, an  apprehension of any public calamity, danger
to one's children, or fear  arising from ferocious beasts or Rakshasas, then Vastu with his  followers should be
meditated upon as above, and then worshipped, and  thus all manner of peace may be obtained by the offer of
oblations of  sesamum−seeds, ghee, and payasa (67−68).
O Suvrata! in these rites the Grahas and the ten Dikpalas should be  worshipped in the same way as Vastu is
worshipped (69).
Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Vani, Lakshmi, the celestial mothers,  Ganesha, and the Vasus, should also be
worshipped (70).
O Kalika! if in these rites the Pitris are not satisfied, then all  which is done becomes fruitless, and there is
danger in every stage  (71).
Therefore, O Maheshi! in all these rites Abhyudayika. Shraddha  should be performed for the satisfaction of
the Pitris (72).
I shall now speak of the Graha−yantra, which is the cause of all  kinds of peace. If Indra and all the planets are
worshipped, then they  grant every desire (73).
In order to draw the yantra three triangles should be drawn with a  circle outside them, and outside, but
touching the circle, eight petals  should be drawn (74).
Then should a beautiful Bhupura be drawn (outside the yantra) with  four entrances, and (outside the Bhupura)
between the East and  North−East corners a circle should be drawn with its diameter the  length of a pradesha,
and between the West and the South−West corners  another similar circle should be drawn (75−76).
Then the nine corners should be filled up with colours of the nine  planets, and the left and right sides of the
two inner triangles should  be made white and yellow, and the base should be black. The eight  petals should
be filled up with the colours of the eight regents of the  quarters (77−78).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
165

The walls of the Bhupura should be decorated with white, red, and  black powders, and, O Devi! the two
circles outside the Bhupura should  be coloured red and white, and the intervening spaces of the yantra may  be
coloured in any manner the wise may choose (79−80).
Listen now to the order in which each planet should be worshipped in  the particular chambers, and in which
each Dikpati should be worshipped  in the particular petals, and as to the names of the Devas who are  present
at each particular entrance (81).
In the inner triangle the Sun should be worshipped, and in the  angles of the two sides Aruna and Shikha.
Behind him with the garland  of rays the two standards of the two fierce ones (Shikha and Aruna)  should be
worshipped (82).
Worship the maker of nights in the corner above the Sun on the East,  in the Agni corner Mangala, on the
South side Budha, in the Nairrita  corner Vrihaspati, on the West Shukra, in the Vayu corner Shani, in the
corner on the North Rahu, and in the Ishana corner Ketu, and, lastly,  round about the Moon the multitude of
stars (83−84). Sun is red, Moon  is white, Mangala is tawny, Budha is pale or yellowish−white,  Vrihaspati is
yellow, Shukra is white, Shani is black, and Rahu and  Ketu are of variegated colour; thus I have spoken of
the different  colours of the Grahas (85−86).
The Sun should be meditated upon as having four hands, in two of  which he is holding lotuses; and of the
other two, one hand is lifted  up to dispel fear, and the other makes the sign of blessing. The Moon  should be
meditated upon as having nectar in one hand, and the other  hand in the attitude of giving. Mangala should be
meditated upon as  slightly bent and holding a staff in his hands. Budha, the son of Moon,  should be meditated
upon as a boy, the locks of whose hair play about  upon his forehead. Guru should be meditated upon with a
sacred thread,  and holding a book in one hand and a string of Rudraksha beads in the  other; and the Guru of
Daityas should be meditated upon as blind of one  eye, and Shani as lame, and Rahu as a trunkless head, and
Ketu as a  headless trunk, both deformed and wicked (86−87).
Having worshipped each of the planets in this manner, the eight  Dikpalas, Indra and others, beginning from
the East, should be  worshipped (89).
He of a thousand eyes, of a yellow colour, should first be  worshipped. He is dressed in yellow silk garments,
and, holding the  thunder in his hand, is seated on Airavata (90).
The body of Agni is of red hue. He is seated on a goat; in his hand  is the Shakti. Yama is black, and, holding
a staff in his hand, is  seated on a bison. Nirriti is of dark green colour, and, holding a  sword in his hand, is
seated on a horse. Varuna is white, and, seated  on an alligator, holds a noose in his hand. Vayu should be
meditated on  as possessed of a black radiance, seated on a deer and holding a hook.  Kuvera is of the colour of
gold, and seated on a jewelled lion−seat,  holding the noose and hook in his hands. He is surrounded by
Yakshas,  who are singing his praises. Ishana is seated on the bull; he holds the  trident in one hand, and with
the other bestows blessings, He is  dressed in raiments of tiger−skin, and his effulgence is like that of  the full
moon (91−95).
Having thus meditated upon and worshipped them in their order,  Brahma should be worshipped in the upper
circle, which is outside the  mandala, and Vishnu in the lower one. Then the Devatas at the entrances  should
be worshipped (96).
Ugra, Bhima, Prachanda, and Isha, are at the eastern entrance;  Jayanta, Kshetra−pala, Nakulesha, and
Vrihat−shirah, are at the  southern entrance; at the door on the west are Vrika, Ashva, Ananda,  and Durjaya;
and Trishirah, Purajit, Bhimanada, and Mahodara are at the  northern entrance. As protectors of the entrances,
they are all armed  with weapons, offensive and defensive (97−98).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)

Suvrata! listen to the meditation on Brahma and Ananta. Brahma is of  the colour of the red lotus, and has four
hands and four faces. He is  seated on a swan. With two of his hands he makes the signs which dispel  fear and
grant boons, and in the others he holds a garland and a book.  Ananta is white as the snow, the Kunda flower,
or the Moon. He has a  thousand hands and a thousand faces, and he should be meditated upon by  Suras and
Asuras (99−101).
Beloved! I have now spoken of the meditation, the mode of worship,  and the yantra. Now, my beloved, listen
to their Mantras in their  order, beginning with the Vastu Mantra (102).

When Ksha−kara is placed on the Carrier of Oblations. and the long  vowels are then added to it, and
ornamented with the nada−vindu, the  six−lettered Vastu Mantra is formed (103).
The Suryya Mantra is thus formed: first the tara should be said;  then the Maya; then the word tigma−rashme;
then the word arogya−daya  (in the dative singular); and, last of all, the wife of Fire (104).
The recognized or approved Mantra of Soma is formed by saying the  vijas of Kama, Maya and Vani, then
Amrita−kara, amritam plavaya plavaya  svaha (105).
The Mantra of Mangala is proclaimed to be Aing hrang hring  sarva−dushtan nashaya nashaya svaha (106).
The Mantra of the son of Soma is Hrang, Shring, Saumya sarvan kaman  puraya svaha(107).
The Mantra of the Sura−Guru is formed thus: Let the tara precede and  follow the Vija of Vani, and then say,
Abhishtam yachchha yachchha, and  lastly svaha (108).
The Mantra of Shukra is Shang, Shing, Shung, Shaing, Shaung, Shngah  (109).
The Mantra of the Slowly Moving One is Hrang hrang hring hring  sarva−shatrun vidravaya vidravaya
Martan−dasunave namah−− Destroy,  destroy all enemies−− I bow to the son of Martanda (110).
The Mantra of Rahu is Rang, Hraung, Bhraung, Hring−− Soma−shatro  shatrun vidhvangsaya vidhvangsaya
Rahave namah−−O Enemy of Soma (Moon)!  destroy, destroy all enemies. I bow to Rahu (111).
Krung, Hrung, Kraing to Ketu−− is proclaimed to be the Mantra of  Ketu (112).
Lang, Rang, Mring, Strung, Vang, Yang, Kshang, Haung, Vring, and Ang  are in their order the ten Mantras
of the ten Dikpalas, beginning with  Indra and ending with Ananta (113).
The names of the other attendant Devas are their Mantras; in all  instances where there is no Mantra
mentioned this is the rule. (114).
Sovereign Mistress of the Devas! the wise man should not add Namah  to Mantras that end with the word
Namah, nor should he put the wife of  Vahni to a Mantra that ends with Svaha (115).
To the Planets and others should be given flowers, clothes, and  jewels, but the colour of the gifts should be
the same as that of the  respective Planets; otherwise they are not pleased (116).
The wise man should place fire in the manner prescribed for  Kushandika, and perform homa either with
flowers of variegated colours  or with sacred fuel (117).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
167

In rites for the attainment of peace or good fortune, or nourishment  or prosperity, the Carrier of Oblations is
called Varada; in rites  relating to consecration he is called Lohitaksha; in destructive rites  he is called
Shatruha (118).
Maheshani! in Shanti, Pushti, and Krura rites the man who sacrifices  to the Planets will obtain the desired end
(119).
As in the rites relating to the consecration the Devas should be  worshipped and libations offered to the Pitris,
so also should there be  the same sacrifices to Vastu and the Planets (120).
Should one have to perform two or three consecratory and sacrificial  rites on the same day, then the worship
of the Devas, the Shraddha of  the Pitris, and consecration of fire are required once only (121).
One who desires the fruit of his observances should not give to any  Deva reservoirs of water, houses,
gardens, bridges, causeways,  carriers, conveyances, clothes, jewels, drinking−cups, and  eating−plates, or
whatever else he may desire to give, without first  sanctifying the same (122−123).
In all rites performed with an ultimate object the wise one should  in all cases perform a sangkalpa, in
accordance with directions, for  the full attainment of the good object (124).
Complete merit is earned when the thing about to be given is first  sanctified, worshipped, and mentioned by
name, and then the name of him  to whom it is given is pronounced (125).
I will now tell you the Mantras for the consecration of reservoirs  of water, houses, gardens, bridges, and
cause−ways. The Mantras should  always be preceded by the Brahma−Vidya (126).
Mantras
Reservoir of Water! thou that givest life to all beings! thou that  art presided over by Varuna! may this
consecration of thee (by me) give  satisfaction to all beings that live and move in water, on land, and in  air
(127).
House made of timber and grass! thou art the favourite of Brahma; I  am consecrating thee with water; do thou
be always the cause of  pleasure (128).
When consecrating a house made of bricks and other materials, one  should say: "House made of bricks," etc.
(129).
Mantras
Garden! thou art pleasant by reason of thy fruits, leaves, and  branches, and by thy shadows. I am sprinkling
thee with the sacred  water (of sacred places); grant me all my wishes (130).
Bridge! thou art like the bridge across the Ocean of Existence, thou  art welcome to the wayfarer; do thou,
being consecrated by me, grant me  the fitting reward thereof (131).
Causeway! I am consecrating thee, as thou helpest people in going  from one place to another: do thou
likewise help me in my way to Heaven  (132).
The wise ones shall use the same Mantra in consecrating a tree as is  prescribed for the sprinkling of a garden
(133).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
168

In consecrating all other things, the Pranava, Varuna, and Astra  should be used (134).
Those vahanas that can (or ought to be) bathed should be bathed with  the Brahma−gayatri; others should be
purified by arghya−water taken up  with the ends of kusha grass (135).
After performing prana−pratishtha, calling it by its name, the  vahana called by its name should be duly
worshipped, and when decked  out should be given to the Devata (136).
Whilst consecrating a reservoir, Varuna, the lord of aquatic  animals, should be worshipped. In the case of a
house, Brahma, the lord  of all things born, should there be worshipped. Whilst consecrating a  garden, a
bridge a causeway, Vishnu, who is the protector of the  universe, the soul of all, who witnesseth all and is
omnipresent,  should be worshipped (137).
Shri Devi said:
Thou hast spoken of the different injunctions relating to the  different rites, but thou hast not yet shown the
order in which man  should practise them (138).
Rites not properly performed according to the order enjoined do not,  even though performed with labour,
yield the full benefit to men who  follow the life of Karmma (139).
Shri Sadashiva said:
O Parameshani! thou art beneficent like a mother. What thou hast  said is indeed the best for men whose
minds are occupied with the  results (of their efforts) (140).
The practices relating to the aforementioned rites are different.  Devi! I am relating them in their order,
beginning with the Vastu−yaga.  Do thou listen attentively (141).
(He who wishes to perform the Vastu−yaga) should the day previous  thereto live on a regulated or a restricted
diet. After bathing in the  early auspicious hour of morning, and performing the ordinary daily  religious
duties, he should worship the Guru and Narayana (142).
The worshipper should then, after making sangkalpa, worship Ganesha  and others for the attainment of his
own object, according to the rules  shown in the ordinances (143).
Dhyanam
Worship Ganapati who is of the colour of the Bandhuka flower, and  has three eyes; whose head is that of the
best of elephants; whose  sacred thread is made of the King of Snakes; who is holding in his four  lotus hands
the conch, the discus, the sword, and a spotless lotus; on  whose forehead is the rising young moon; the
shining effulgence of  whose body and raiments is like that of the Sun; who is decked with  various jewels, and
is seated on a red lotus (144).
Having thus meditated upon and worshipped Ganesha to the best of his  ability, he should worship Brahma,
Vani, Vishnu, and Lakshmi (145).
Then, after worshipping Shiva, Durga, the Grahas, the sixteen  mothers, and the Vasus in the Vasudhara, he
should perform the  Vriddhishraddha (146).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
169

Then the mandala of the Vastu−daitya should be drawn, and there the  Vastu−daitya with his followers should
be worshipped (147).
Then there make a sthandila and purifying fire as before; first  perform Dhara−homa, and then commence
Vastu−homa (148).
Oblations should be offered to the Vastu−purusha and all his  followers according to the best of one's ability.
The sacrifice should  be brought to a close by the gift of oblations to the Devas worshipped  (149).
When Vastu−yajna is separately performed, this is the order which is  prescribed, and in this order also the
sacrifice to the planets should  be performed (150).
Moreover, the Planets being the principal objects of worship, they  should not be subordinately worshipped.
The Vastu should be worshipped  immediately after the sangkalpa (151).
Ganesha and the other Devas should be worshipped as in Vastu−yaga. I  have already spoken to you of the
Yantra and Mantra and Dhyana of the  Planets (152).
I have, O Gentle One! during my discourse with thee spoken of the  order to be observed in the yajnas of the
planets and of Vastu. I shall  now speak to thee of the various praiseworthy acts, beginning with the
consecration of wells (153).
After making sangkalpa in the proper manner, Vastu should be  worshipped either in a mandala, or a jar, or a
Shilagrama, according to  inclination (154).
Then Ganapati should be worshipped, as also Brahma and Vani, Hari,  Rama, Shiva, Durga, the Planets, the
Dikpatis (155).
Then the Matrikas and the eight Vasus having been worshipped,  Pitrikriya should be performed. Since
Varuna is principal Deva (for the  purposes of this ceremony), he should then be worshipped with  particular
care (156).
Having worshipped Varuna with various presents to the best of his  ability, Varuna Homa should then be
performed in Fire duly consecrated  (157). And after offering oblations to each of the Devas worshipped, he
should bring the Homa rite to an end by giving the Purnahuti (158).
Then he should sprinkle the excellent well, decorated with  flagstaffs and flags, garlands, scents, and
vermilion, with the  Prokshana Mantra, spoken of before (159).
Then he should, in the name of the Deva, or for the attainment of  the object of his desire, give away the well
or tank for the benefit of  all beings (160).
Then the most excellent worshipper should make supplication with  folded palms as follows:
"Be well pleased, all beings, whether living in the air or on earth  or in water; I have given this excellent water
to all beings; may all  beings be satisfied by bathing in, drinking from, or plunging into this  water; I have
given this common water to all beings. Should anyone by  his ownmisfortune be endangered in this, may I not
be guilty of that  sin, may my work (good work) bear fruit!" (161−163).
Then presents should be made, and Shanti and other rites performed,  and thereafter Brahmanas, Kaulas, and
the hungry poor should be fed.  Shive! this is the order to be observed in the consecration of all  kinds of
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
170

reservoirs of water (164−165).
In the consecration of a Tadaga and other kinds of reservoirs of  water there should be a Nagastambha and
some aquatic animals (166).
Aquatic animals, such as fish, frogs, alligators, and tortoises,  should be made of metal, according to the
means of the person  consecrating (167). There should be made two fish and two frogs of  gold, two alligators
of silver, and two tortoises, one of copper and  another of brass (168).
After giving away the Tadaga or Dirghika or Sagara with these  aquatic animals, Naga should, after having
been supplicated, be  worshipped (169).
Ananta, Vasuki, Padma, Mahapadma, Takshaka, Kulira, Karkata, and  Shankha−− all these are the protectors
of water (170).
These eight names of the Nagas should be written on Ashvattha  leaves, and, after making japa of the Pranava
and the Gayatri, the leaf  should be thrown into a jar (171).
Calling upon Sun and Moon to witness, the leaves should be mixed up  together, and one−half should be
drawn therefrom, and the Naga whose  name is drawn should be made the protector of water (172).
Then a wooden pillar, auspicious and straight, should be brought and  smeared with oil and turmeric, and
bathed in consecrated water, to the  accompaniment of the Vyahriti and the Pranava, and then the Naga who
has been made the protector of the water should be worshipped with the  Shaktis Hri, Shri, Kshama, and
Shanti (173−174).
Mantra
O Naga! Thou art the couch of Vishnu, Thou art the adornment of  Shiva; do Thou inhabit this pillar and
protect my water (175).
Having thus made supplication to Naga, the pillar should be set in  the middle of the reservoir, and the
dedicator should then go round the  Tadaga, keeping it on his right (176).
If the pillar has been already fixed, then the Naga should be  worshipped in a jar, and, throwing the water of
the jar into the  reservoir, the remainder of the rites should be performed (177).
Similarly, the wise man who has taken a vow to consecrate a house  should perform the rites, beginning with
the worship of Vastu, and  ending with that of the Vasus, and perform the rites relating to the  Pitris as
prescribed for the consecration of a well, and the excellent  devotee should worship Prajapati and do
Prajapatya homa (178−179).
The house should be sprinkled with the Mantra already mentioned, and  then worshipped with incense, etc.;
after that, with his face to the  Ishana corner, he should pray as follows (180):
Mantra
"O Room (or House)! Prajapati is thy Lord; decked with flowers and  garlands and other decorations, be thou
always pleasant for our happy  residence." (181).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
171

He should then offer presents, and, performing Shanti rites, accept  blessings. Thereafter he should feed
Vipras, Kulinas, and the poor to  the best of his ability (182).
O Daughter of the Mountain! if the house is being consecrated for  someone else, then in the place "our
residence" should be said "their  residence"; and now listen to the ordinances relating to the  consecration of a
house (or room) for a Deva (183).
After consecrating the house in the above manner, the Deva should be  approached with the blowing of
conch−shells and the sound of other  musical instruments, and he should be supplicated thus (184):
Mantra
Rise, O Lord of the Deva among Devas! thou that grantest the desires  of thy votaries! come and make my life
blessed, O Ocean of Mercy! (185).
Having thus invited (the Deva) into the room, he should be placed at  the door, and the Vahana should be
placed in front of Him (186).
Then on the top of the house a trident or a discus should be placed,  and in the Ishana corner a staff should be
set with a flag flying from  it (187).
Let the wise man then decorate the room with awnings, small bells,  garlands of flowers, and mango−leaves,
and then cover the house up with  celestial cloth (188).
The Deva should be placed with his face to the North, and in the  manner to be described he should be bathed
with the things prescribed.  I now am speaking of their order; do thou listen (189).
After saying Aing, Hring, Shring, the Mula Mantra should be  repeated, and then let the worshipper say:
Mantra
I am bathing thee with milk; do thou cherish me like a mother (190).
Repeating the three Vijas and the Mula Mantra aforesaid, let him  then say:
Mantra
I am bathing thee to−day with curds; do thou remove the heat of this  mundane existence (191).
Repeating again the three Vijas and the Mula Mantra, let him say:
Mantra
O Giver of Joy to all! being bathed in honey, do Thou make me joyful  (192).
Repeating the Mula Mantra as before, and inwardly reciting the  Pranava and the Savitri, he should say:
Mantra
I am bathing Thee in ghee, which is dear to the Devas, which is  longevity, seed, and courage; do Thou, O
Lord! keep me free from  disease (193).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
172

Again repeating the Mula Mantra, as also the Vyahriti and the  Gayatri, let him say:
Mantra
O Devesha ! bathed by me in sugar water, do Thou grant me (the  object of) my desire (194).
Repeating the Mula Mantra, the Gayatri, and the Varuna Mantra, he  should say:
Mantra
I am bathing thee with cocoanut−water, which is the creation of the  Vidhi, which is divine, which is welcome
to Devas, and is cooling, and  which is not of the world; I bow to thee (195).
Then, with the Gayatri and the Mula Mantra, the Deva should be  bathed with the juice of sugar−cane (196).
Repeating the Kama Vija and the Tara, the Savitri, and the Mula  Mantra, he should, whilst bathing the Deva,
say:
Mantra
Be thou well bathed in water scented with camphor, fragrant aloe,  saffron, musk, and sandal; be thou pleased
to grant me enjoyment and  salvation (197).
After bathing the Lord of the World in this manner with eight  jarfuls (of water, etc.), He should be brought
inside the room and  placed on His seat (198).
If the image be one which cannot be bathed, then the Yantra, or  Mantra, or the Shalagrama−shila, should be
bathed and worshipped (199).
If one be not able to bathe (the Deva) in manner above, then he  should bathe (Him) with eight, seven, or five
jars of pure water (200).
The size and proportions of the jar has been already given whilst  speaking of Chakra worship. In all rites
prescribed in the Agmas that  is the jar which is appropriate (201).
Then the Great Deva should be worshipped according to the  injunctions to be followed in His worship. I shall
speak of the  offerings. Do thou, O Supreme Devi! Listen (202).
A seat, welcome, water to wash the feet, offerings, water for  rinsing the mouth, Madhuparka, water
forsipping, bathing water, clothes  and jewels, scents and flowers, lights and incense−sticks, edibles and
words of praise, are the sixteen offerings requisite in the worship of  the Devas (203−204).
Padya, Arghya, Achamana, Madhuparka, Achamya, Gandha, Pushpa, Dhupa,  Dipa, Naivedya−− these are
known as Dashopachara (ten requisite  offerings) (205).
Gandha, Pushpa, Dhupa, Dipa, and Naivedya, are spoken of as the  Panchopachara (five offerings) in the
worship of a Deva (206).
The articles should be sprinkled with water taken from the offering  with the Weapon Mantra, and be
worshipped with scents and flowers, the  names of separate articles being mentioned. (207)
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
173

Mentally repeating the Mantra that is about to be said, as also the  Mula Mantra, and the name of the Deva in
the dative case, the words of  gift should be repeated (208).
I have told you of the way in which the things to be given to the  Devas should be dedicated. The learned man
should in this manner give  away an article to a Deva (209).
I have shown (whilst describing) the mode of worship of the Adya  Devi how Padya, Arghya, etc., should be
offered, and how Karana should  be given (210).
To such of the Mantras as were not spoken then, do thou, O Beloved !  listen to them here; these should be
said when Asana and other  requisites are offered (211).
Mantra
(O Deva!) Thou who residest within all beings! who art the innermost  of all beings! I am offering this seat for
Thee to sit. I bow to Thee  again and again (212).
O Deveshi! after giving the excellent asana in this way, the giver  of the asana sbould with folded arms bid
him welcome as follows (213):
Mantra
(O Deva!) Thou art He whom even the Devas seek for the  accomplishment of their objects, yet for me Thy
auspicious visit has  easily been obtained. I bow to Thee, O Supreme Lord! (214).
My life's aim is accomplished to−day; all my efforts are crowned  with success; I have obtained the fruits of
my tapas−− all this by Thy  auspicious coming (215).
Ambika! the Deva should thus be invited, prayed to, and questioned  as to His auspicious coming, and then,
taking padya, the following  Mantra should be repeated (216):
Mantra
By the mere touch of the washings of Thy feet the three worlds are  purified; I am offering Thee padya for
washing Thy lotus feet (217). He  by whose grace is attained all manner of supreme bliss, to Him who is  the
Soul of all beings I offer this Anandarghya (218).
Then pure water which has been scented with nutmeg, cloves, and  kakkola, should be poured out, and taken
and offered with the following  (219):
Mantra
(O Lord!) By the mere touch of that which Thou hast touched the  whole of this impure world is purified; for
washing that lotus mouth I  offer thee this achamaniya (220).
Then, taking madhuparka, offer it with devotion and with the  following (221):
Mantra
For the destruction of the three afflictions, for the attainment of  uninterrupted bliss, I give Thee to−day, O
Parameshvara! this  madhuparka; be Thou propitious (222).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
174

By the mere touch of anything which has touched Thy mouth things  impure become pure: this
punarachama−niyam is for the lotus mouth of  Thine (223).
Taking water for the bath, and pouring it and consecrating it as  before, it should be placed before the Deva,
and the following Mantra  should be repeated (224):
Mantra
To Thee whose splendour envelops the world, from whom the world was  born, who is the support of the
world, do I offer this water for Thy  bath (225).
When offering bathing water, clothes, and edibles, achamaniya should  be given as each is offered, and, after
offering other articles, water  should be given only once (226).
Bringing the cloth consecrated as aforementioned, holding it up with  both hands, the wise man should repeat
the following (227):
Mantra
Without any raiments as Thou art, Thou hast kept Thy splendour or  glory concealed by Thy maya. To Thee I
offer these two pieces of cloth.  I bow to Thee (228).
Taking different kinds of ornaments made of gold and silver and  other materials, and sprinkling and
consecrating them, he should offer  them to the Deva, uttering the following (229):
Mantra
To Thee who art the ornament of the Universe, who art the one cause  of the beauty of the universe, I offer
these jewels for the adornment  of Thy illusion−image (230).
Mantra
To Thee who by the subtle element of smell hast created the earth  which possesses all scents, to Thee, the
Supreme Soul, I offer this  excellent scent (231).
Mantra
By me have been dedicated with devotion beautiful flowers, and  charming and sweet scents prepared by
Devas: do Thou accept this fiower  (232).
Mantra
This incense−stick is the sap of the trees; it is Divine, and  possesses a delicious scent, and is charming, and is
fit to be inhaled  by all beings. I give it to Thee to smell (233).
Mantra
Do Thou accept this light which illumines and has a strong flame,  which removes all darkness, and which is
brightness itself, and makes  bright that which is around it (234).
Mantra
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
175

This offering of food is of delicious taste, and consists of various  kinds of edibles. I offer it to Thee in a
devout spirit; do Thou  partake of it (235).
Mantra
O Deva! this clear drinking−water, perfumed with camphor and other  scents which satisfies all, I offer to
Thee−− Salutation to Thee (236).
The worshipper should then offer pan  made with camphor, catechu,  cloves, cardamums, and, after offering
achamaniya, bow to Him (237).
If the offerings are presented along with the vessels in which they  are contained, then the names and
description of the offerings may  jointly be repeated when making the present, or the names (or  description) of
the vessels may separately be said and the same given  (238).
Having worshipped the Deva in this manner, three double handfuls of  flowers should be given to the Deva.
Then, sprinkling the temple and  its awnings with water, the following Mantra should be said with folded
palms (239):
Mantra
Temple! thou art adorable of all men; thou grantest virtue and fame.  In affording a resting−place to this Deva,
do thou be like unto Sumeru  (240). Thou art Kailasa, thou art Vaikuntha, thou art the place of  Brahma, since
thou art holding the Deva, who is the adored of the Devas  within thee (241).
Since thou holdest within thyself the image of Him whose body is  produced by Maya, and within whose belly
exists this universe, with all  that is movable and immovable therein (242). Thou art the equal of the  Mother
of the Devas; all the holy places are in thee; do thou grant all  my desires, and do thou bring me peace. I bow
to thee (243).
Having thus praised the temple decorated with the discus, flag,  etc., and worshipped it three times, the
worshipper should give it to  the Deva, mentioning the object of his desire (444).
Mantra
To Thee, whose abode is the universe for Thy residence, I dedicate  this temple.O Maheshana! do Thou accept
it and in Thy mercy abide here  (245).
Having said this and having made presents, the Deva to whom the  temple has been dedicated should be
placed on the altar to the  accompaniment of the music of conches, horns, and other instruments  (246).
He should then touch the two feet of the Deva and utter the Mula  Mantra, and say, Sthang! Sthing! be Thou
steady; this temple is made by  me for Thee, and, having fixed the Deva there, he should pray again to  the
temple thus (247):
Mantra
Temple! be thou always in every way pleasant for the residence of  the Deva; thou hast been dedicated by me;
may the Lokas be lasting and  without danger for me (248).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
176

Help my fourteen generations of ancestors, my fourteen generations  of successors, and me and the rest of my
family to find places to  reside in the abode of the Devas (249).
May I, by thy grace, attain the fruits attainable by performing all  forms of yajnas, by visiting all the places of
pilgrimage (250).
May my line continue so long as this world, so long as these  mountains, so long as the Sun and Moon endure
(251).
The wise man, after having thus addressed the temple and worshipped  the Deva, should dedicate mirrors and
other articles and the flag to  Him (252).
Then the Vahana appropriate to the Deity should be given. To Shiva  should be given a bull. Then pray to
Him thus (253):
Mantra
O Bull! thou art large of body, thy horns are sharp, thou killest  all enemies, thou art worshipped even by the
Tridashas, as thou  carriest on thy back the Lord of the Devas (254).
In thy hoofs are all the holy shrines, in thy hair are all the Vedic  Mantras, in the tip of thy teeth are all the
Nigamas, Agamas, and  Tantras (255).
May the husband of Parvati, pleased with this gift of thee, give me  a place in Kailasa, and do thou protect me
always (256).
O Maheshani! do Thou listen to the manner of prayer upon giving a  lion to Mahadevi or a Garuda to Vishnu
(257).
Mantra
Thou didst display thy great strength in the wars between the Suras  and the Asuras; thou didst give victory to
the Devas, and didst destroy  the Demons. Thou formidable one, thou art the favourite of the Devi,  thou the
favourite of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva; with devotion I am  dedicating thee to the Devi; do thou destroy my
enemies. I bow to thee  (258−259).
O Garuda! most excellent bird! Thou art the favoured one of the  husband of Lakshmi; Thy beak is hard like
adamant; Thy talons are  sharp, and golder are Thy wings. I bow to Thee, O Indra among birds! I  bow to
Thee, O King of birds! (260).
As Thou abidest near Vishnu with folded palms, do Thou, O Destroyer  of the pride of enemies! help me to be
there as Thou art (261). When  Thou art pleased, the Lord of the Universe is pleased, and grants  success (262).
When a gift is made to any Deva, an additional present should be  made to the Deva for His acceptance of
such gifts, and the merit of  such rites should also be given to Him in a spirit of devotion (263).
He should then, with dancing, singing, and music, go round the  temple, accompanied by his friends and
kinsmen, keeping the temple on  his right, and, having bowed to the Deva, feed the twice−born! (264).
This is the way in which a temple to a Deva should be dedicated, and  the same rule is to be observed in the
dedication of a garden, a  bridge, a causeway, or a tree (265).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
177

With this difference only: that in these rites the ever−existing  Vishnu should be worshipped; but Puja and
Homa, etc., are the same as  in the case of the dedication of a temple (266).
No temple or other thing should be dedicated to a Deva whose image  has not been consecrated. The rules laid
down above are for the worship  of and dedication to a Deva who has been worshipped and consecrated  (267).
I shall now speak of the manner in which the auspicious Adya should  be installed, and by which the Devi
grants quickly all desires (268).
On the morning of the day (of Pratishtha) the worshipper should,  after bathing and purifying himself, sit
facing the North, and, having  taken Sangkalpa, worship the Vastu−devata (269).
After performing the worship of the planets, the Protectors of the  Quarters, Ganesha and others, and having
performed the Shraddha of his  Pitris, he should approach the image with a number of devout Vipras  (270).
The excellent worshipper should then bring the image to the temple  which has been dedicated, or to some
other place, and there duly bathe  it (271).
It should first be bathed with water, then with sandy earth, then  with mud thrown up by the tusk of the boar or
elephant, then with mud  taken from the door of a Veshya, and then with mud from the lake of  Pradyumna
(272).
The wise man should then bathe the image with Pancha−kashaya and  Pancha−pushpa, and three leaves, and
then with scented oil (273).
The decoctions of Vatyala, Vadari, Jambu, Vakula, and Shalmali, are  called the five Kashayas for bathing the
Devi (274).
Karavira, Jati, Champaka, Lotus, and Patali, are the five flowers  (275).
By three leaves are meant the leaves of Varvvara, Tulasi, and Vilva  (276).
With the above−mentioned articles water should be mixed, but no  water should be put into scented oil and
the five nectars (277).
He should, after repeating the Vyahriti, the Pranava, the Gayatri,  and the Mula Mantra, say, "I bathe thee with
the water of these  articles" (278).
The wise man should then bathe the image with the eight jars filled  with milk and other ingredients in
manners aforementioned (279).
The image should then be rubbed with powdered white wheat or sesamum  cakes, or powdered shali rice, and
thus cleansed (280).
After bathing the image with eight jars of holy water, and rubbing  it with cloth of fine texture, it should bc
brought to the place of  worship (281).
Should one be unable to perform all these rites, then he should in a  devout spirit bathe the image with
twenty−five jars of pure water (282).
On each occasion that the Great Devi is bathed she should, to the  best of one's ability, be worshipped (283).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
178

Then, placing the image on a well−cleaned seat, She should be  worshipped by offering padya, arghya, etc.,
and then prayed to (as  follows) (284):
Mantra
O Image! thou that art the handicraft of Vishvakarmma, I bow to  thee; thou art the abode of the Devi, I bow
to thee; thou fulfillest  the desire of the votary, I bow to thee (285).
In thee I worship the most excellent primordial Supreme Devi; if  there be any defect in thee by reason of the
want of skill of him who  has fashioned thee, do thou make it good; I bow to thee (286).
He should then restrain his speech, and, placing his hand over the  head of the Image, inwardly do japa of the
Mula Mantra one hundred and  eight times, and thereafter do Anga−nyasa (287).
He should then perform Shadanga−nyasa and Matri−kanyasa on the body  of the Image, and, when
performing Shadanga−nyasa, add one after the  other the six long vowels to the Vija (288).
The eight groups of the letters of the alphabet preceded by the  Tara, Maya, and Rama, with the Vindu, added
to them, and followed by  Namah, should be placed in different parts of the body of the Deva  (289).
The wise man should place the vowels in the mouth; kavarga in the  throat; chavargaon the belly; tavarga on
the right and tavarva on the  left arm; pavarga on the right thigh, and yavarga on the left thigh,  and shavarga
on the head (290−291).
Having placed these groups of the letters of the alphabet on  different parts of the image (the worshipper)
should perform  Tattva−nyasa (as follows): (292)
Place on the two feet Prithivi−tattva; on the Linga Toya−tattva; on  the region of the navel Tejas−tattva; on
the lotus of the heart  Vayu−tattva; on the mouth Gagana−tattva; on the two eyes Rupa−tattva;  on the two
nostrils Gandha−tattva; on the two ears Shabda−tattva; on  the tongue Rasa−tattva; on the skin Sparsha−tattva.
The foremost of  worshippers should place Manas−tattva between the eyebrows,  Shiva−tattva, Jnana−tattva,
and Para−tattva on the lotus of a thousand  petals; on the heart Jiva−tattva and Prakriti−tattva. Lastly, he
should  place Mahat−tattva and Ahangkara−tattva all over the body. The tattvas  should, whilst being placed,
be preceded by Tara, Maya, and Rama, and  should be uttered in the dative singular, followed by namah
(293−297).
Repeating the Mula Mantra, preceded and followed by each of the  Matrika−varnas, with vindu added to
them, and followed by the word  namah, Matrika−nyasa should be performed at the Matrikasthanas (298).
(The worshipper should then say):
Mantra
(Although) Thy radiance embraces all the sacrifices, and although  Thy body embraces all being, this is the
image that has been made of  Thee. I place Thee here (299).
Thereafter the Devi should be meditated upon and invoked, according  to the rules of worship, and after
Prana−pratishtha the Supreme Devata  should be worshipped (300).
The Mantras which are prescribed for the dedication of a temple to a  Deva should be used in this ceremony,
the necessary changes in gender  being made (301).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 13 − Installation of the  Devata
179

The Devi should then be invoked into the fire, which has in due form  been consecrated by the offer of
oblations to the Devatas who are to be  worshipped; and thereafter the Devi should be worshipped, and
jata−karmma, etc., should be performed (302).
The Sangskaras are six in number−− viz., Jatakarmma, Namakarana,  Nishkramana, Annaprashana,
Chudikarana, and Upanayana−− this has been  said by Shiva (303).
Repeating the Pranava, the Vyahritis, the Gayatri, the Mula Mantra,  the worshipper used in the injunctions
should say, "thine," and then  the name of (the sangskara) jatakarmma, and others, and uttering, "I  perform,
Svaha," offer five oblations at the end of each sangskara  (304−305).
Thereafter repeating the Mula Mantra and the name (given to the  Devi), one hundred oblations should be
offered, and the remnants of  each oblation should be thrown over the head of the Devi (306).
The wise man, after having brought the ceremony to a close by  Prayashchitta and other rites, should feed and
thus please Sadhakas and  Vipras and the poor and the helpless (307).
Should anyone be unable to perform all these rites, he should bathe  (the Deva) with seven jars of water, and,
having worshipped to the best  of his ability, repeat the name of the Devi (308).
Beloved! I have now spoken to Thee of the Pratishtha of the  illustrious Adya. In a similar way should men
versed in the regulations  carefully perform the Pratishtha of Durga and other Vidyas, Mahesha,  and other
Devatas, and of the Shiva−lingas that may be moved (309−310).
End of the Thirteenth Joyful Message, entitled "Installation of the  Devata."
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and
Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas
SHRI DEVI said: 
I am grateful to Thee, O Lord of Mercy! in that Thou hast in Thy  discourse upon the Worship of the Adya
Shakti, spoken, in Thy mercy, of  the mode of Worship of various other Devas (1).
Thou hast spoken of the Installation of a Movable Shiva−linga, but  what is the object of installing an
immovable Shiva−linga, and what are  the rites relating to the installation of such a Linga? (2).
Do Thou, O Lord of the Worlds! now tell Me all the particulars  thereof; for say, who is there but Thee that I
can honour by My  questions anent this excellent subject? (3).
Who is there that is Omniscient, Merciful, All−knowing, Omnipresent,  easily satisfied, Protector of the
humble, like Thee? Who makes My joys  increase like Thee? (4).
Shri Sadashiva said:
What shall I tell Thee of the merit acquired by the installation of  a Shiva−linga? By it a man is purified of all
great sins, and goes to  the Supreme Abode (5).
There is no doubt that by the installation of a Shiva−linga a man  acquires ten million times the merit which is
acquired by giving the  world and all its gold, by the performance of ten thousand  horse−sacrifices, by the
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas180

digging of a tank in a waterless country, or  by making happy the poor and such as are enfeebled by disease
(6−7).
Kalika! Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, and the other Devas reside where  Mahadeva is in His linga form (8).
Thirty−five million known and unknown places of pilgrimage and all  the holy places abide near Shiva. The
land within a radius of a hundred  cubits of the linga is declared to be Shiva−kshetra (9−10).
This land of Isha is very sacred. It is more excellent than the most  excellent of holy places, because there
abide all the Immortals and  there are all the holy places (11).
He who in a devout spirit lives there, be it even for but a little  while, becomes purged of all sins, and goes to
the heaven of Shangkara  after death (12).
Anything great or small (meritorious or otherwise) which is done in  this land of Shiva becomes multiplied (in
its effect) by the majesty of  Shiva (13).
All sins committed elsewhere are removed (by going) near Shiva, but  sins committed in Shiva−kshetra
adhere to a man with the strength of a  thunderbolt (14).
The merit acquired by the performance there of Purashcharana, japa,  acts of charity, Shraddha, tarpana, or
any other pious acts is eternal  (15).
The merit acquired by the performance of a hundred Purashcharana at  times of lunar or solar eclipse is
acquired by merely performing one  japa near Shiva (16).
By the offering of Pinda once only in the land of Shiva, a man  obtains the same fruit as he who offers ten
million pindas at Gaya, the  Ganges, and Prayaga (17).
Even in the case of those who are guilty of many sins or of great  sins attain the supreme abode if Shraddha be
performed in their names  in the land of Shiva (18).
The fourteen worlds abide there where abides the Lord of the  Universe in His Linga form with the auspicious
Devi Durga (19).
I have spoken a little about the majesty of the immovable Mahadeva  in His linga form. The mahima of the
Anadi−linga is beyond the power of  words to express (20).
O Suvrat! even in Thy worship at the Mahapithas the touch of an  untouchable is unclean, but this is not so in
the worship of Hara in  His linga image (21).
O Devi! as there are no prohibitions at the time of Chakra worship,  so know this, O Kalika! that there are
none in the holy shrine in  Shiva's land (22).
What is the use of saying more? I am but telling Thee the very truth  when I say that I am unable to describe
the glory, majesty, and  sanctity of the linga image of Shiva (23).
Whether the Linga is placed on a Gauri−patta or not, the worshipper  should, for the successful attainment of
his desires, worship it  devoutly (24).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas181

The excellent worshipper earns the merit of (performing) ten  thousand horse−sacrifices if he performs the
Adhivasa of the Deva in  the evening previous to the day of installation (25).
The twenty articles to be used in the rite of Adhivasa are: Earth,  Scent, a Pebble, Paddy, Durvva grass,
Flower, Fruit, Curds, Ghee,  Svastika, Vermillion, Conch−shell, Kajjala, Rochana, White Mustard  Seed,
Silver, Gold, Copper, Lights, and a Mirror (26−27).
Taking each of these articles, the Maya Vija and the Brahma−Gayatri  should be repeated, and then should be
said "Anena" (with this) and  "Amushya" (of this one's or his or hers)−− "may the auspicious Adhivasa  be"
(28).
And then the forehead of the worshipped divinity should be touched  with the earth and all other articles
aforesaid. Then Adhivasa should  be performed with the Prashasti−patra−− that is, the receptacle should  be
lifted up, and with it the forehead of the image should be touched  three times (29).
The worshipper conversant with the ordinances, having thus performed  the Adhivasa of the Deva, should
bathe the deity with milk and other  liquids, as directed in the ceremony relating to the dedication of a  temple
(30).
Rubbing the linga with a piece of cloth and placing it on its seat,  Ganesha and other Deities should be
worshipped according to the rules  prescribed for their worship (31).
Having performed Kara−nyasa and Anga−nyasa and Pranayama with the  Pranava, the ever−existent Shiva
should be meditated upon.
Dhyana
As tranquil, possessed of the effulgence of ten million Moons;  clothed in garments of tiger−skins; wearing a
sacred thread made of a  serpent; His whole body covered with ashes; wearing ornaments of  serpents; His five
faces are of reddish−black, yellow, rose, white, and  red colours, with three eyes each; His head is covered
with matted  hair; He is Omnipresent; He holds Ganga on His head, and has ten arms,  and in His forehead
shines the (crescent) Moon; He holds in His left  hand the skull, fire, the noose, the Pinaka, and the axe, and in
His  right the trident, the thunderbolt, the arrow, and blessings; He is  being praised by all the Devas and great
Sages; His eyes half−closed in  the excess of bliss; His body is white as the snow and the Kunda flower  and
the Moon; He is seated on the Bull; He is by day and night  surrounded on every side by Siddhas, Gandharvas,
and Apsaras, who are  chanting hymns in His praise; He is the husband of Uma; the devoted  Protector of His
worshippers (32−38).
Having thus meditated upon Mahadeva and worshipped Him with articles  of mental worship, He should be
invoked into the Linga, and worshipped  to the best of one's powers, and as laid down in the ordinances
relating to such worship (39).
I have already spoken of the Mantras for the giving of Asana and  other articles of worship. I shall now speak
of the Mula Mantra of the  Great Mahesha (40).
Maya, Tara, and the Shabda Vija, with Au and Ardhendu−Vindu added to  it, is the Shiva Vija−− that is,
"Hring Ong Haung." (41).
Covering Shangkara with clothes and garland of sweet−smelling  flowers, and placing Him on a beautiful
couch, the Gauri−patta should  be consecrated in manner above−mentioned (42).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas182

The Devi should be worshipped in the Gauri−patta according to the  following rites: with the Maya Vija,
Anga−nyasa, Kara−nyasa, and  Pranayama should be performed (43).
The Great Devi should, to the best of the worshipper's ability, be  worshipped after meditation upon Her as
follows:
Dhyana
I meditate upon the stainless One, Whose splendour isthat of a  thousand rising Suns, Whose eyes are like
Fire, Sun and Moon, and Whose  lotus face in smiles is adorned with golden earrings set with lines of  pearls.
With her lotus hands She makes the gestures which grant  blessings and dispel fear, and holds the discus and
lotus; Her breasts  are large and rounded; She is the Dispeller of all fear, and She is  clothed in
saffron−coloured raiments.
Having thus meditated upon Her, the ten Dikpalas and the Bull should  be worshipped to the best of one's
powers (44−45).
I will now speak of the Mantra of the Bhagavati, by which the  World−pervading One should be worshipped
(46).
Repeating the Maya, Lakshmi Vijas, and the letter which follows Sa  with the sixth vowel, with the Vindu
added to it, and thereafter  uttering the name of the Wife of Fire, the Mantra is formed (which is  as follows):
Mantra
Hring Shring Hung Svaha (47).
Placing the Devi as aforementioned, offerings should be made to all  the Devas with a mixture of Masha
beans, rice, and curds, with sugar,  etc., added to it (48).
These articles of worship should be placed in the Ishana corner, and  purified with the Varuna Vija, and
should be offered after purification  with scents and flowers and the following (49)
Mantra
O Devas, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Uragas, Rakshasas, Pishachas,'  Mothers, Yakshas, Bhutas, Pitris, Rishis, and
other Devas! do you  quietly take this offering, and do you stay surrounding Mahadeva and  Girija (50−51).
Then japa should be made of the Mantra of the Great Devi as often as  one may, and then with excellent songs
and instrumental music let the  festival be celebrated (52).
Having completed the Adhivasa in manner above, the following day  after performance of the compulsory
daily duties, and having taken the  vow, the Five Devas should be worshipped (53).
After worshipping the Matris and making the Vasudhara, and  performing Vriddhi−Shraddha, the
Door−keepers of Mahesha should, in a  calm and devout frame of mind, be worshipped (54).
The Door−keepers of Shiva are−− Nandi, Maha−bala, Kishavadana, and  Gana−nayaka; they are all armed
with missiles and other weapons (55).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas183

Bringing the Linga and Tarini, as represented by the Gauri−patta,  they should be placed on a Sarvato−bhadra
Mandala, or on an auspicious  seat (56).
Shambhu should then be bathed with eight jars of water with the  Mantra "Tryambaka," etc., and worshipped
with the sixteen articles of  worship (57).
After bathing the Devi in a similar way with the Mula Mantra, and  worshipping Her, the good worshipper
should pray to Shangkara with  joined palms (58).
Mantra
Come, O Bhagavan! O Shambhu! O Thou before Whom all Devas bow! I bow  to Thee, Who art armed with
the Pinaka, Thee the Lord of all, O Great  Deva (59).
O Deva! Thou Who conferrest benefits on Thy votaries! do Thou in Thy  mercy come to this temple with
Bhagavati: I bow to Thee again and again  (60).
O Mother! O Devi! O Mahamaya! O All−beneficent One! be Thou along  with Shambhu pleased: I bow to
Thee, O Beloved of Hara (61).
Come to this house, O Devi! Thou Who grantest all boons, be Thou  pleased, and do Thou grant me all
prosperity (62).
Rise, O Queen of Devas! and Each with Thy followers abide happy in  this place; may Both of You be
pleased, You Who are kind to your  devotees (63).
Having thus prayed to Shiva and the Devi, They should first be  carried three times round the Temple, keeping
the latter on the right  to the accompaniment of joyful sounds, and then taken inside (64).
Repeating the Mula Mantra, one−third of the Linga should be set in a  hollow made in a piece of stone or in a
masonry hole (65). (With the  following Mantra):
Mantra
O Mahadeva! do Thou remain here so long as the Moon and the Sun  endure, so long as the Earth and the
Oceans endure: I bow to Thee (66).
Having firmly fixed Sadashiva with this Mantra, the Gauri−patta,  with its tapering end to the North, should
be placed on the Linga, that  it may be entered by the latter (67).
Mantra
Be still, O Jagad−dhatri! Thou That art the Cause of creation,  existence, and destruction of things; abide Thou
here so long as the  Sun and the Moon endure (68).
Having firmly fixed it, the Linga should be touched and the  following (Mantra) should be repeated (69):
Mantra
I invoke that Deva Who has three eyes, the Decayless, Ishana, around  whose lion−seat are tigers, Bhutas,
Pishachas, Gandharvas, Siddhas,  Charanas, Yakshas, Nagas, Vetalas, Loka−palas, Maharshis, Matris,
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas184

Gana−nathas, Vishnu Brahma, and Vrihaspati, and all beings which live  on earth or in the air; come, O
Bhagavan! to this Yantra, which is the  handiwork of Brahma, for the prosperity, happiness, and Heaven of all
(70−72).
Beloved! Shiva should then be bathed according to the injunctions  relating to the consecration of a Deva, and,
having been meditated upon  as before−mentioned, should be worshipped with mental offerings (73).
After placing a special arghya,' and having worshipped the  Gana−devatas, and meditated upon Mabesha
again, flowers should be  placed on the Linga (74).
Repeating the Shakti Vija between Pasha and Angkusha, and the  letters from Ya to Sa with the nasal point,
and then " Haung Hangsa,"  the life of Sadashiva should be infused into the Linga (75).
Then, smearing the Husband of the Daughter of the Mountain with  sandal, aguru, and saffron, He should be
worshipped with the sixteen  articles of worship according to the injunctions laid down after  performing the
jata, the nama, and other rites (76).
After concluding everything according to the injunctions, and after  worshipping the Devi in the Gauri−patta,
the eight images of the Deva  should be carefully worshipped (77).
By the name Sharva the Earth is meant; by Bhava is meant Water; by  Rudra, Fire; by Ugra, Wind; by Bhuna,
Ether; by Pashu−pati is meant the  Employer of a priest for sacrifice; by Mahadeva, the Source of Nectar,  and
by Ishana, the Sun: these are declared to be the Eight Images  (78−79).
Each of these should be invoked and worshipped in their order (in  the corners), beginning with the East and
ending with the North−East,  uttering the Pranava first and Namah last (80).
After having worshipped Indra and the other Dikpalas, the eight  Matris, Brahmi, and others, the worshipper
should give to Isha the  Bull, awning, houses, and the like (81).
Then, with joined palms, he should with fervour pray to the Husband  of Parvati (as follows) (82):
Mantra
O Ocean of Mercy! O Lord! Thou hast been placed in this place by me;  be Thou pleased (with me). O
Shambhu! Thou Who art the Cause of all  causes, do Thou abide in this room, O Supreme Deva! so long as
the  Earth with all its Oceans exist, so long as the Moon and the Sun  endure. I bow to Thee. Should there
occur the death of any living  being, may I, O Dhurjjati! by Thy grace, be kept from that sin (83−85).
The dedicator should go round the image, keeping it on his right,  and, having bowed before the Deva, go
home. Returning again in the  morning, he should bathe Chandra−Shekhara (86).
He should first be bathed with consecrated Panchamrita with a  hundred jars of scented water, and the
worshipper, having worshipped  Him to the best of his powers, should pray to Him (as follows) (87−88):
Mantra
O Husband of Uma,! if there has been any irregularity, omission,  want of devotion in this worship, may they
all, by Thy grace, be  rectified, and may my fame remain incomparable in this world so long as  Moon, the
Sun, the Earth, and its Oceans endure (89−90).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas185

I bow to the three−eyed Rudra, Who wields the excellent Pinaka, to  Him Who is worshipped by Vishnu,
Brahma, Indra, Suryya, and other  Devas, I bow again and again (91).
The worshipper should then make presents, and feast the  Kaulika−dvijas, and give pleasure to the poor by
gifts of food, drink,  and clothes (92).
The Deva should be worshipped every day according to one's means.  The fixed Shiva−linga should on no
account be removed (93).
Parameshvari! I have in brief spoken to you of the rites relating to  the consecration of the immovable
Shiva−linga, gathering same from all  the Agamas (94).
Shri Devi said:
If, O Lord! there be an accidental omission in the worship of the  Devas, then what should be done by their
votaries−− do Thou speak in  detail about this (95).
Say, on account of what faults are images of Devas unfit for  worship, and should thus be rejected, and what
should be done? (96).
Shri Sadashiva said:
If there be an omission to worship an image for a day, then (the  next day) the worship should be twice
performed; if for two days, then  the worship should be four times performed; if for three days, then it  should
be celebrated eight times (97).
If the omission extends three days, but does not exceed six months,  then the wise man should worship after
bathing the Deva with eight jars  of water (98).
If the period of omission exceeds six months, then the excellent  worshipper should carefully consecrate the
Deva according to the rules  already laid down, and then worship Him (99) 
The wise man should not worship the image of a Deva which is broken  or is holed, or which has lost a limb,
or has been touched by a leper,  or has fallen on unholy ground (100).
The image of a Deva with missing limbs, or which is broken or has  holes in it, should be consigned to water.
If the image has been made  impure by touch, it should be consecrated, and then worshipped (101).
The Mahapithas and Anadi−lingas are free from all deficiencies, and  these should always be worshipped for
the attainment of happiness by  each worshipper as he pleases (102).
Mahamaya! whatever Thou hast asked for the good of men who act with  a view to the fruits of action, I have
answered all this in detail  (103).
Men cannot live without such actions even for half amoment. Even  when men are unwilling, they are, in spite
of themselves, drawn by the  whirlwind of action (104).
By action men enjoy happiness, and by action again they suffer pain.  They are born, they live, and they die
the slaves of action (105).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas186

It is for this that I have spoken of various kinds of action, such  as S,dhana and the like, for the guidance of the
intellectually weak in  the paths of righteousness, and that they may be restrained from wicked  acts (106).
There are two kands of action−− good and evil; the effect of evil  action is that men suffer acute pain (107).
And, O Devi! those who do good acts with minds intent on the fruits  thereof go to the next world, and come
back again to this, chained by  their action (108).
Therefore men will not attain final liberation even at the end of a  hundred kalpas so long as action, whether
good or evil, is not  destroyed (109).
As a man is bound, be it by a gold or iron chain, so he is bound by  his action, be it good or evil (110).
So long as a man has not real knowledge, he does not attain final  liberation, even though he be in the constant
practice of religious  acts and a hundred austerities (111).
The knowledge of the wise from whom the darkness of ignorance is  removed, and whose souls are pure,
arises from the performance of duty  without expectation of fruit or reward, and by constant meditation on  the
Brahman (112).
He who knows that all which is in this universe from Brahma to a  blade of grass is but the result of Maya,
and that the Brahman is the  one and supreme Truth, has this (113).
That man is released from the bonds of action who, renouncing name  and form, has attained to complete
knowledge of the essence of the  eternal and immutable Brahman (114).
Liberation does not come fram japa, homa, or a hundred fasts; man  becomes liberated by the knowledge that
he himself is Brahman (115).
Final liberation is attained by the knowledge that the Atma (Soul)  is the witness, is the Truth, is omnipresent,
is one, free from all  illuding distractions of self and not−self, the supreme, and, though  abiding in the body, is
not in the body (116).
All imagination of name−form and the like are but the play of a  child. He who put away all this sets himself
in firm attachment to the  Brahman, is, without doubt, liberated (117).
If the image imagined by the (human) mind were to lead to  liberation, then undoubtedly men would be Kings
by virtue of such  kingdoms as they gain in their dreams (118).
Those who (in their ignorance) believe that Ishvara is (only) in  images made of clay, or stone, or metal, or
wood, merely trouble  themselves by their tapas. They can never attain liberation without  knowledge (119).
Can men attain final liberation by restriction in food, be they ever  so thin thereby, or by uncontrolled
indulgence, be they ever so gross  therefrom, unless they possess the knowledge of Brahman? (120).
If by observance of Vrata to live on air, leaves of trees, bits of  grain, or water, final liberation may be
attained, then snakes, cattle,  birds, and aquatic animals should all be able to attain final  liberation (121).
Brahma−sad−bhava is the highest state of mind; dhyana−bhava is  middling; stuti and japa is the last; and
external worship is the  lowest of all (122).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas187

Yoga is the union of the embodied soul and the Supreme Soul," Puja  is the union of the worshipper and the
worshipped; but he who realizes  that all things are Brahman for him there is neither Yoga nor Puja  (123).
For him who possesses the knowledge of Brahman, the supreme  knowledge, of what use are japa, yajna,"
tapas, niyama, and vrata?  (124).
He who sees the Brahman, Who is Truth, Knowledge, Bliss, and the  One, is by his very nature one with the
Brahman. Of what use to him are  puja, dhyana, and dharana? (125).
For him who knows that all is Brahman there is neither sin nor  virtue, neither heaven nor future birth. There
is none to meditate  upon, nor one who meditates (126).
The soul which is detached from all things is ever liberated; what  can bind it? From what do fools desire to be
liberated? (127).
He abides in this Universe, the creation of His powers of illusion,  which even the Devas cannot pierce. He is
seemingly in the Universe,  but not in it (128).
The Spirit, the eternal witness, is in its own nature like the void  which exists both outside and inside all
things, and which has neither  birth nor childhood, nor youth nor old age, but is the eternal  intelligence which
is ever the same, knowing no change or decay  (129−130).
It is the body which is born, matures, and decays. Men enthralled by  illusion, seeing this, understand it not
(131).
As the Sun (though one and the same) when reflected in different  platters of water appears to be many, so by
illusion the one soul  appears to be many in the different bodies in which it abides (132).
As when water is disturbed the Moon which is reflected in it appears  to be disturbed, so when the intelligence
is disturbed ignorant men  think that it is the soul which is disturbed (133).
As the void inside a jar remains the same ever after the jar is  broken, so the Soul remains the same after the
body is destroyed (134).
The knowledge of the Spirit, O Devi! is the one means of attaining  final liberation; and he who possesses it is
verily−− yea, verily−−  liberated in this world, even yet whilst living, there is no doubt of  that (135).
Neither by acts, nor by begetting offspring, nor by wealth is man  liberated; it is by the knowledge of the
Spirit, by the Spirit that man  is liberated (136).
It is the Spirit that is dear to all; there is nothing dearer than  the Spirit;O Shive! it is by the unity of Spirits
that men become dear  to one another (137).
Knowledge, Object of knowledge, the knower appear by illusion to be  three different things; but if careful
discrimination is made, Spirit  is found to be the sole residuum (138).
Knowledge is Spirit in the form of intelligence, the object of  knowledge is Spirit whose substance is
intelligence, the Knower is the  Spirit Itself. He who knows this knows the Spirit (139).
I have now spoken of knowledge which is the true cause of final  liberation. This is the most precious
possession of the four classes of  Avadhutas (140).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas188

Shri Devi said:
Thou hast spoken of the two stages in the life of man−− namely, that  of householder and mendicant; what is
this wonderful distinction of  four classes of Avadhutas which I now hear? (141).
I wish to hear and clearly understand the distinctive features of  the four classes of Avadhutas: do Thou, O
Lord! speak (about them)  truly (142).
Shri Sadashiva said:
Those Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and other castes who are worshippers of  the Brahma−mantra should be known
to be Yatis, even though they be  living the life of a householder (143).
O Worshipped of the Kulas! those men who are sanctified by the rites  of Purnabhisheka should be known and
honoured as Shaivavadhutas (144).
Both the Brahma and Shaiva Avadhutas shall do all acts in their  respective states of life according to the way
directed by me (145).
They should not partake of forbidden food or drink unless the same  has been offered to the Brahman or
offered in the Chakra (146).
O Beauteous One! I have already spoken of the customs and Dharmma of  the Kaulas, who are Brahma
Avadhutas, and of the Kaulas who have been  initiated. For Brahma and Shaiva Avadhutas, bathing, eating
evening  meals, drinking, the giving of charities, and marital intercourse  should be done according to the way
prescribed by the Agamas (147−148).
The above Avadhutas are of two classes, according as they are  perfect or imperfect. Beloved! the perfect one
is called Parama−hangsa,  and the other or imperfect one is called Parivrat (149).
The man who has gone through the Sangskara of an Avadhuta, but whose  knowledge is yet imperfect, should,
by living the life of a  householder, purify his spirit  (150).
Preserving his caste−mark and practising the rites of a Kaula, he  should, remaining constantly devoted to the
Brahman, cultivate the  excellent knowledge (151).
With his mind ever free from attachment, yet discharging all his  duty, he should constantly repeat "Ong Tat
Sat," and constantly think  upon and realize the saying, "Sah aham" (152).
Doing his duties, his mind as completely detached as the water on  the lotus leaf, he should constantly strive
to free his soul by the  knowledge of Divine truth and discrimination (153).
The man, be he a householder or an ascetic, who commences any  undertaking with the Mantra "Ong Tat Sat,"
is ever successful therein  (154).
Japa, homa, pratishtha, and all sacramental rites, if performed with  the Mantra "Ong Tat Sat," are faultess
beyond all doubt (155).
What use is there of the various other Mantras? What use of the  other multitudinous practices? With this
Brahma Mantra alone may all  rites be concluded (156).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas189

Ambika! this Mantra is easily practised, is not prolix, and gives  complete success, and there is no other way
besides this great Mantra  (157).
If it be kept written in any part of the house or on the body, then  such house becomes a holy place and the
body becomes sanctified (158).
O Deveshi! I am telling Thee the very truth when I say that the  Mantra "Ong Tat Sat" is superior to the
essence of essences of the  Nigamas, the Agamas, and the Tantras (159).
This most excellent of Mantras, "Ong Tat Sat," has pierced through  the palate, the skull, and crownlock of
Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, and  has thus manifested itself (160).
If the four kinds of food and other articles are sanctified by this  Mantra, then it becomes useless to sanctify
them by any other Mantras  (161).
He is a King among Kaulas, who sees the Great Being everywhere, and  constantly makes japa of the great
Mantra "Tat Sat" (i.e., Ong Tat  Sat), acts as he so inclines, and is pure of heart withal (162).
By japa of this Mantra a man becomes a Siddha; by thinking of its  meaning he is liberated, and he who, when
making japa, thinks of its  meaning, becomes like unto the Brahman in visible form (163).
This Great, Three−footed Mantra is the cause of all causes; by its  sadhana one becomes the Conqueror of
Death himself (164).
O Maheshani! the worshipper attains siddhi in whatsoever way he  makes japa of it (165).
He who, renouncing all acts (rites), has been cleansed by the  Sangskara of a Shaiva Avadhuta, ceases to have
any right to worship  Devas, to perform the Shraddha of the Pitris, or to honour the Rishis  (166).
Of the four classes of Avadhutas, the fourth is called the Hangsa  (Parama−hangsa). The other three both
practise yoga and have enjoyment.  They are all liberated and are like unto Shiva (167).
The Hangsa should not have intercourse with women, and should not  touch metals. Unfettered by restrictions,
he moves about enjoying the  fruits of his meritorious acts done in previous lives (168).
The fourth class, removing his caste−marks and relinquishing his  household duties, should move about in this
world without aim or  striving (169).
Always pleased in his own mind, he is free from sorrow and illusion,  homeless and forgiving, fearless, and
doing harm to none (170).
For him there is no offering of food and drink (to any Deva); for  him there is no necessity for dhyana or
dharana, the Yati is liberated,  is free from attachment, unaffected by all opposites, and follows the  ways of a
Hangsa (171).
O Devi! I have now spoken to Thee in detail of the distinctive marks  of the four classes of Kula−Yogis, who
are but images of Myself (172).
By seeing them, by touching them, conversing with them, or pleasing  them, men earn the fruit of pilgrimage
to all the holy places (173).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas190

All the shrines and holy places which there are in this world, they  all, O my Beloved! abide in the body of the
Kula−Sannyasi (174).
Those men who have worshipped Kula Sadhus with
Kula−dravya are indeed blessed and holy, have attained their desired  aim, and have earned the fruit of all
sacrifices (175).
By mere touch of these Sadhus the impure becomes pure, the  untouchable becomes touchable, and food unfit
to be eaten becomes fit  to be eaten. By their touch even the Kiratas, the sinful, the wicked,  the Pulindas, the
Yavanas, and the wicked and ferocious, are made pure;  who else but they should be honoured? (176−177).
Even those who but once worship the Kaulika Yogi with Kula−tattva  and Kula−dravya become worthy of
honour in this world (178).
O Thou with the lotus face! there is no Dharmma superior to  Kaula−Dharmma, by seeking refuge in which
even a man of inferior caste  becomes purified and attains the state of a Kaula (179).
As the footmarks of all animals disappear in the footmark of the  elephant, so do all other Dharmmas
disappear in the Kula−Dharmma (180).
My Beloved! how holy are the Kaulas! They are like the images of the  holy places. They purify by their
merepresence even the Chandalas and  the vilest of the vile (181).
As other waters falling into Ganga become the water of Ganga, so all  men following Kulachara reach the
stage of a Kaula (182).
As water gone into the sea does not retain its separateness, so men  sunk in the ocean of Kula lose theirs (183).
All beings in this world which have two feet, from the Vipra to the  inferior castes, are competent for
Kulachara (184).
Those that are averse to the acceptance of Kula−Dharmma, even when  invited, are divorced from all
Dharmma and go the downward path (185).
The Kulina who deceived those men who seek for Kulachara shall go to  the hell named Raurava (186).
That low Kaula who refuses to initiate a Chandala or a Yavana into  the Kula−Dharmma, considering them to
be inferior, or a woman out of  disrespect for her, goes the downward way (187).
The merit acquired by a hundred Abhisheka, by the performance of a  hundred Purashcharana, ten million
times that merit is acquired by the  initiation of one man into the Kula−Dharmma (188).
All the different castes, all the followers of the different  Dharmmas in this world, are, by becoming Kaulas,
freed from their  bonds, and go to the Supreme Abode (189).
The Kaulas who follow that Shaiva−Dharmma are like places of  pilgrimage, and possess the soul of Shiva.
They worship and honour one  another with affection, respect, and love (190).
What is the use of saying more? I am speaking the very truth before  Thee when I say that the only bridge for
the crossing of this ocean of  existence is the Kula− Dharmma and none other (191).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas191

By the following of Kula−Dharmma all doubts are cut through, all the  accumulation of sins is destroyed, and
the multitude of acts is  destroyed (192).
Those Kaulikas are excellent who, truthful and faithful to the  Brahman, in their mercy invite men to purify
them by Kulachara (193).
Devi! I have spoken to Thee the first portion of the Maha−nirvana  Tantra for the purification of men. It
contains the conclusions of all  Dharmmas (194).
He who hears it daily or enables other men to hear it becomes freed  from all sins, and attains Nirvana at the
end (195).
By knowing this King among Tantras, which contains the essence of  essence of all the Tantras, and is the
most excellent among the  Tantras, a man becomes versed in all the Shastras (196).
The man who knows this Maha−Tantra is freed fromthe bonds of  actions. Of what use is it to him to go on
pilgrimage, or to do japa,  yajna, and sadhana? (197).
Kalika! he who knows this Tantra, is conversant with all the  Shastras, he is pre−eminent among the virtuous,
is wise, knows the  Brahman, and is a Sage (198).
There is no use of the Vedas, the Puranas, the Smritis,. the  Sanghitas, and the various other Tantras, as by
knowing this Tantra one  knows all (199).
All the most secret rites and practices and the most excellent  knowledge have been revealed by me in reply to
Thy questions (200).
Suvrata! as Thou art my most excellent Brahmi Shakti, and art to me  dearer than life itself, know Thou that
the Mahanirvana Tantra is  likewise (201).
As the Himalaya is among the Mountains, as the Moon is among the  Stars, as the Sun is among all lustrous
bodies, so this Tantra is the  King among Tantras (202).
All the Dharmmas pervade this Tantra. It is the only means for the  acquirement of the knowledge of
Brahman. The man who repeats himself or  causes others to repeat it will surely acquire such knowledge (203).
In the family of the man in whose house there is this most excellent  of all Tantras there will never be a Pashu
(204).
The man blinded by the darkness of ignorance, the fool caught in the  meshes of his actions, and the illiterate
man, by listening to this  Great Tantra, are released fromthe bonds of karmma (205).
Parameshani! reading, listening to, and worshipping this Tantra, and  singing its praise, gives liberation to
men (206).
Of the other various Tantras each deals with one subject only. There  is no other Tantra which contains all the
Dharmmas (207).
The last part contains an account of the nether, earthly, and  heavenly worlds. He who knows it (along with
the first) undoubtedly  knows all (208).
 Mahanirvana Tantra (Tantra of the Great Liberation)
Chapter 14 − The Consecration of  Shiva−linga and Description of the Four Classes of Avadhutas192

The man who knows the second part with this book is able to speak of  the past, present, and future, and
knows the three worlds (209).
There are all manner of Tantras and various Shastras, but they are  not equal to a sixteenth part (in value) of
this Mahanirvana Tantra  (210).
What further shall I tell Thee of the greatness of the Mahanirvana  Tantra? Through the knowledge of it one
shall attain to Brahma−nirvana  (211).
