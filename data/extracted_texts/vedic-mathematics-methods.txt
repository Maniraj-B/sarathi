Preface  
       
The Sanskrit word Veda is derived from the root Vid, meaning to know 
without limit. The word Veda covers all Veda-sakhas known to humanity. The 
Veda is a repository of all knowledge, fathomless, ever revealing as it is 
delved deeper.  
 
Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha (1884-1960), former Jagadguru Sankaracharya 
of Puri culled a set of 16 Sutras (aphorisms) and 13 Sub - Sutras (corollaries) 
from the Atharva Veda. He developed methods and techniques for amplifying 
the principles contained in the aphorisms and their corollaries, and called it 
Vedic Mathematics.  
 
According to him, there has been considerable literature on Mathematics in 
the Veda-sakhas. Unfortunately most of it has been lost to humanity as of 
now. This is evident from the fact that while, by the time of Patanjali, about 
25 centuries ago, 1131 Veda-sakhas were known to the Vedic scholars, only 
about ten Veda-sakhas are presently in the knowledge of the Vedic scholars 
in the country.  
 
The Sutras apply to and cover almost every branch of Mathematics. They 
apply even to complex problems involving a large number of mathematical 
operations. Application of the Sutras saves a lot of time and effort in solving 
the problems, compared to the formal methods presently in vogue. Though 
the solutions appear like magic, the application of the Sutras is perfectly 
logical and rational. The computation made on the computers follows, in a 
way, the principles underlying the Sutras. The Sutras provide not only 
methods of calculation, but also ways of thinking for their application.  
 
This book on Vedic Mathematics seeks to present an integrated approach to 
learning Mathematics with keenness of observation and inquisitiveness, 
avoiding the monotony of accepting theories and working from them 
mechanically. The explanations offered make the processes clear to the 
learners. The logical proof of the Sutras is detailed in algebra, which 
eliminates the misconception that the Sutras are a jugglery.  
 
Application of the Sutras improves the computational skills of the learners in 
a wide area of problems, ensuring both speed and accuracy, strictly based on 
rational and logical reasoning. The knowledge of such methods enables the 
teachers to be more resourceful to mould the students and improve their 
talent and creativity. Application of the Sutras to specific problems involves 
rational thinking, which, in the process, helps improve intuition that is the 
bottom - line of the mastery of the mathematical geniuses of the past and the 
present such as Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya, Srinivasa Ramanujan, etc.

This book makes use of the Sutras and Sub-Sutras stated above for 
presentation of their application for learning Mathematics at the secondary 
school level in a way different from what is taught at present, but strictly 
embodying the principles of algebra for empirical accuracy. The innovation in 
the presentation is the algebraic proof for every elucidation of the Sutra or 
the Sub-Sutra concerned.

                            I. Why Vedic Mathematics?  
Many Indian Secondary School students consider Mathematics a very difficult 
subject. Some students encounter difficulty with basic arithmetical 
operations. Some students feel it difficult to manipulate symbols and balance 
equations. In other words, abstract and logical reasoning is their hurdle.  
 
Many such difficulties in learning Mathematics enter into a long list if prepared 
by an experienced teacher of Mathematics. Volumes have been written on the 
diagnosis of 'learning difficulties' related to Mathematics and remedial 
techniques. Learning Mathematics is an unpleasant experience to some 
students mainly because it involves mental exercise.  
 
Of late, a few teachers and scholars have revived interest in Vedic 
Mathematics which was developed, as a system derived from Vedic principles, 
by Swami Bharati Krishna Tirthaji in the early decades of the 20th century.  
 
Dr. Narinder Puri of the Roorke University prepared teaching materials based 
on Vedic Mathematics during 1986 - 89. A few of his opinions are stated 
hereunder:  
 
i) Mathematics, derived from the Veda, provides one line, mental and super- 
fast methods along with quick cross checking systems.  
 
ii) Vedic Mathematics converts a tedious subject into a playful and blissful one 
which students learn with smiles.  
 
iii) Vedic Mathematics offers a new and entirely different approach to the 
study of Mathematics based on pattern recognition. It allows for constant 
expression of a student's creativity, and is found to be easier to learn.  
 
iv) In this system, for any problem, there is always one general technique 
applicable to all cases and also a number of special pattern problems. The 
element of choice and flexibility at each stage keeps the mind lively and alert 
to develop clarity of thought and intuition, and thereby a holistic development 
of the human brain automatically takes place.  
 
v) Vedic Mathematics with its special features has the inbuilt potential to 
solve the psychological problem of Mathematics - anxiety.  
 
J.T.Glover (London, 1995) says that the experience of teaching Vedic 
Mathematics' methods to children has shown that a high degree of 
mathematical ability can be attained from an early stage while the subject is 
enjoyed for its own merits.

4 
 
A.P. Nicholas (1984) puts the Vedic Mathematics system as 'one of the most 
delightful chapters of the 20th century mathematical history'.  
 
Prof. R.C. Gupta (1994) says 'the system has great educational value because 
the Sutras contain techniques for performing some elementary mathematical 
operations in simple ways, and results are obtained quickly'.  
 
Prof. J.N. Kapur says 'Vedic Mathematics can be used to remove math-
phobia, and can be taught to (school) children as enrichment material along 
with other high speed methods'.  
 
Dr. Michael Weinless, Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the 
M.I.U, Iowa says thus: 'Vedic Mathematics is easier to learn, faster to use and 
less prone to error than conventional methods. Furthermore, the techniques 
of Vedic Mathematics not only enable the students to solve specific 
mathematical problems; they also develop creativity, logical thinking and 
intuition.'  
 
Keeping the above observations in view, let us enter Vedic Mathematics as 
given by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji (1884 - 1960), Sankaracharya of 
Govardhana Math, Puri. Entering into the methods and procedures, one can 
realize the importance and applicability of the different formulae (Sutras) and 
methods.

                       II. Vedic Mathematical Formulae 
What we call VEDIC MATHEMATICS is a mathematical elaboration of 'Sixteen 
Simple Mathematical formulae from theVedas' as brought out by Sri 
Bharati Krishna Tirthaji. In the text authored by the Swamiji, nowhere has 
the list of the Mathematical formulae (Sutras) been given. But the Editor of the 
text has compiled the list of the formulae from stray references in the text. The 
list so compiled contains Sixteen Sutras and Thirteen Sub - Sutras as stated 
hereunder. 
 
SIXTEEN SUTRAS

6 
 
THIRTEEN SUB – SUTRAS 
 
In the text, the words Sutra, aphorism, formula are used synonymously. So are 
also the words Upa-sutra, Sub-sutra, Sub-formula, corollary used. 
Now we shall have the literal meaning, contextual meaning, process, different 
methods of application along with examples for the Sutras. Explanation, 
methods, further short-cuts, algebraic proof, etc follow. What follows relates to 
a single formula or a group of formulae related to the methods of Vedic 
Mathematics.

7 
 
1. Ekadhikena Purvena 
The Sutra (formula) Ekādhikena Pūrvena means: “By one more than the 
previous one”. 
i) Squares of numbers ending in 5 :  
Now we relate the sutra to the ‘squaring of numbers ending in 5’. Consider the 
example 252. 
Here the number is 25. We have to find out the square of the number. For the 
number 25, the last digit is 5 and the 'previous' digit is 2. Hence, 'one more 
than the previous one', that is, 2+1=3. The Sutra, in this context, gives the 
procedure'to multiply the previous digit 2 by one more than itself, that is, by 3'. 
It becomes the L.H.S (left hand side) of the result, that is, 2 X 3 = 6. The R.H.S 
(right hand side) of the result is52, that is, 25. 
Thus  252 = 2 X 3 / 25 = 625. 
In the same way,  
352= 3 X (3+1) /25 = 3 X 4/  25 = 1225; 
 
652= 6 X 7 / 25 = 4225; 
 
1052= 10 X 11/25 = 11025; 
 
1352= 13 X 14/25 = 18225; 
   
 
 
   Apply the formula to find the squares of the numbers 15, 45, 85, 125, 175 and  verify the answers. 
 
Algebraic proof:  
 a)  Consider (ax + b)2 Ξ a2. x2+  2abx + b2. 
 
Thisidentity for  x = 10   and b = 5 becomes  
(10a + 5) 2 =  a2 . 102  + 2. 10a . 5 + 52  
 
                 =  a2 . 102+ a.102+ 52 
 
                 =  (a2+ a ) . 102 +52

8 
 
                 =  a (a + 1) . 102 + 25.  
 
     Clearly 10a + 5 represents two-digit numbers 15, 25, 35, -------,95 for the values a = 1, 2, 3, --
-----,9 respectively. In such a case the number (10a + 5)2 is of the form whose L.H.S is a (a + 1) 
and R.H.S is 25, that is, a (a + 1) / 25. 
 
     Thus any such two digit number gives the result in the same fashion.  
 
     Example:    45 = (40 + 5)2, It is of the form (ax+b)2 for a = 4, x=10  
                            and b = 5. giving the answer a (a+1) / 25 
                                    that is, 4 (4+1) / 25 + 4 X 5 / 25 = 2025. 
 
b)  Any three digit number is of the form ax2+bx+c for x =10, a ≠ 0, a, b, c Є 
W.  
 
    Now (ax2+bx+ c) 2 =  a2 x4 + b2x2 + c2 + 2abx3 + 2bcx + 2cax2 
 
                                = a2 x4+2ab.x3+(b2+ 2ca)x2+2bc . x+ c2. 
 
    This identity for x = 10, c = 5becomes  (a . 102 + b .10 + 5) 2  
 
                        = a2.104+ 2.a.b.103 + (b2+ 2.5.a)102+ 2.b.5.10 + 52 
 
                        = a2.104+ 2.a.b.103 + (b2 + 10 a)102 + b.102+ 52  
                        = a2.104+ 2ab.103+ b2.102+ a . 103 + b 102+ 52 
 
                        = a2.104 + (2ab + a).103 + (b2+ b)102 +52 
 
                        = [ a2.102 +2ab.10 + a.10 + b2 + b] 102+ 52 
 
                        = (10a + b) ( 10a+b+1).102 + 25

9 
 
                         = P (P+1) 102+ 25,  where P = 10a+b. 
 
Hence any three digit number whose last digit is 5 gives the same result as in 
(a) for P=10a + b, the ‘previous’ of  5. 
 
Example :    1652= (1 . 102 + 6 . 10 + 5) 2. 
It is of the form (ax2+bx+c)2for a = 1, b = 6, c = 5 and x = 10. It gives the 
answer P(P+1) / 25, where P = 10a + b = 10 X 1 + 6 = 16, the ‘previous’. The 
answer is 16 (16+1) / 25 = 16 X 17 / 25 = 27225. 
 
        Apply Ekadhikena purvena to find the squares of  the numbers 95, 225, 
375, 635, 745, 915, 1105, 2545.
 
ii) Vulgar fractions whose denominators are numbers ending in NINE : 
    We now take examples of 1 / a9, where a = 1, 2, -----, 9. In the conversion 
of such vulgar fractions into recurring decimals, Ekadhika process can be 
effectively used both in division and multiplication. 
 
a) Division Method  :  Value of 1 / 19. 
The numbers of decimal places before repetition is the difference of numerator 
and denominator, i.e.,, 19 -1=18 places. 
For the denominator 19, the purva (previous) is 1. 
Hence Ekadhikena purva (one more than the previous) is 1 + 1 = 2. 
The sutra is applied in a different context.  Now the method of division is as 
follows: 
Step. 1 :  Divide numerator 1 by 20. 
 
       i.e.,, 1 / 20  =  0.1 / 2  = .10 ( 0 times, 1 remainder)  
Step. 2 :  Divide 10  by  2

10 
 
       i.e.,,  0.005( 5 times, 0 remainder ) 
Step. 3 : Divide  5  by  2  
 
       i.e.,,  0.0512 ( 2 times, 1 remainder ) 
 
 Step. 4 : Divide  12  i.e.,, 12  by  2 
 
       i.e.,,  0.0526 ( 6 times, No remainder ) 
 
 Step. 5 :    Divide  6  by  2  
 
       i.e.,,   0.05263 ( 3 times, No remainder ) 
 
 Step. 6 :    Divide  3  by  2 
 
        i.e.,,  0.0526311(1 time, 1 remainder ) 
 
 Step. 7 :    Divide  11   i.e.,, 11  by  2  
 
        i.e.,,  0.05263115  (5 times, 1 remainder ) 
 
 Step. 8 :    Divide  15  i.e.,,  15  by  2 
 
         i.e.,,  0.052631517 ( 7 times, 1 remainder ) 
 
 Step. 9 :    Divide 17    i.e.,,   17  by  2 
 
         i.e.,,   0.05263157 18 (8 times, 1 remainder )  
 
 Step. 10 :  Divide  18  i.e.,,  18  by  2 
 
         i.e.,,  0.0526315789 (9 times, No remainder )  
 
 Step. 11 :  Divide  9  by  2  
 
         i.e.,,  0.0526315789 14 (4 times, 1 remainder ) 
 
 Step. 12 :  Divide  14   i.e.,,  14  by  2  
 
         i.e.,,  0.052631578947 ( 7 times, No remainder ) 
 
 
 
 Step. 13 :  Divide  7  by  2

11 
 
          i.e.,,  0.05263157894713 ( 3 times, 1 remainder )  
 
 Step. 14 : Divide  13    i.e.,,   13  by  2  
 
          i.e.,,  0.052631578947316 ( 6 times, 1 remainder )  
 
 Step. 15 : Divide  16     i.e.,,   16  by  2 
 
          i.e.,,   0.052631578947368 (8 times, No remainder )  
 
 Step. 16 : Divide  8  by  2  
 
          i.e.,, 0.0526315789473684 ( 4 times, No remainder )  
 
 Step. 17 : Divide  4  by  2 
 
          i.e.,,  0.05263157894736842 ( 2 times, No remainder ) 
 
 Step. 18 : Divide  2  by 2  
 
          i.e.,, 0.052631578947368421 ( 1 time, No remainder ) 
 
Now from step 19, i.e.,, dividing 1 by 2, Step 2 to Step. 18 repeats thus giving 
 
               0 __________________        .                       . 
        1 / 19 =0.052631578947368421 or 0.052631578947368421  
 
Note that we have completed the process of division only by using ‘2’. Nowhere 
the division by 19 occurs. 
b) Multiplication Method: Value of 1 / 19 
First we recognize the last digit of the denominator of the type 1 / a9. Here the 
last digit is 9. 
For a fraction of the form in whose denominator 9 is the last digit, we take the 
case of 1 / 19 as follows: 
For 1 / 19, 'previous' of 19 is 1. And one more than of it is 1 + 1 = 2. 
Therefore 2 is the multiplier for the conversion. We write the last digit in the 
numerator as 1 and follow the steps leftwards. 
 
Step. 1 :                                        1

12 
 
 
Step. 2 :                                      21(multiply 1 by 2, put to left) 
 
Step. 3 :                                   421(multiply 2 by 2, put to left) 
 
Step. 4 :                                8421(multiply 4 by 2, put to left) 
 
Step. 5 :                              168421 (multiply 8 by 2 =16,   1 carried over, 6 put to left) 
 
Step. 6 :                            1368421 ( 6 X 2 =12,+1 [carry over] 
 
                                                   = 13, 1 carried over, 3 put to left ) 
 
Step. 7 :                          7368421 ( 3 X 2, = 6 +1 [Carryover] 
 
                                                  = 7, put to left) 
 
Step. 8 :                        147368421 (as in the same process) 
 
Step. 9 :                       947368421  ( Do – continue to step 18) 
 
Step. 10 :                   18947368421  
 
Step. 11 :                  178947368421 
 
Step. 12 :                1578947368421 
 
Step. 13 :               11578947368421 
 
Step. 14 :                31578947368421 
 
Step. 15 :               631578947368421 
 
Step. 16 :              12631578947368421 
 
Step. 17 :             52631578947368421 
 
Step. 18 :           1052631578947368421 
 
Now from step 18 onwards the same numbers and order towards left continue. 
 
Thus  1 / 19 = 0.052631578947368421 
 
It is interesting to note that we have 
 
    i)  not at all used division process

13 
 
 
    ii) instead of dividing 1 by 19 continuously, just multiplied 1 by 2 and continued to multiply 
the resultant successively by 2. 
 
Observations : 
 
   a) For any fraction of the form 1 / a9 i.e.,, in whose denominator 9 is the digit in the units place 
and a is the set of remaining digits, the value of the fraction is in recurring decimal form and the 
repeating block’s right most digit is 1. 
 
   b) Whatever may be a9, and the numerator, it is enough to follow the said process with (a+1) 
either in division or in multiplication. 
 
   c) Starting from right most digit and counting from the right, we see ( in the given example 1 /  
19)  
 
     Sum of 1st digit + 10th digit  =  1 + 8 = 9 
 
    Sum of 2nd digit + 11th digit  =  2 + 7 = 9 
 
     - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sum of 9th digit + 18th digit = 9+ 0 = 9 
 
    From the above observations, we conclude that if we find first 9 digits, further digits can 
be derived as complements of 9. 
 
     i) Thus at the step 8 in division process we have 0.052631517 and next step. 9 gives 
0.052631578 
 
Now the complements of the numbers 
                                0, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5, 7, 8 from 9  
                                9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 2, 1 follow the right order  
 
                                        i.e.,, 0.052631578947368421 
 
             Now taking the multiplication process we have 
 
Step. 8 :         147368421

Step. 9 :         947368421 
 
    Now the complements of 1,  2, 4,  8,  6, 3, 7,  4, 9 from 9 
                              i.e.,, 8, 7, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 5, 0 precede in successive steps, giving the answer. 
 
                          0.052631578947368421. 
d) When we get (Denominator – Numerator) as the product in the multiplicative 
process, half the work is done. We stop the multiplication there and 
mechanically write the remaining  half of the answer by merely taking down 
complements from 9. 
e) Either division or multiplication process of giving the answer can be put in a 
single line form. 
 
Algebraic proof : 
Any vulgar fraction of the form 1 / a9 can be written as 
 1 / a9 =  1 / ( (a + 1 ) x - 1 ) where x = 10

    This series explains the process of ekadhik. 
 
     Now consider the problem of 1 / 19. From above we get 
 
    1 / 19  =  10-1 (1/(1+1)) + 10-2 (1/(1+1)2) + 10-3 (1/(1+1)3) + ---- 
                                                                                 ( since a=1) 
 
               =  10-1 (1/2) + 10-2 (1/2)2 + 10-3 (1/3)3 + ----------

    Example1 : 
 
    1. Find 1 / 49 by ekadhikena process. 
    Now ‘previous’ is 4. ‘One more than the previous’ is 4 + 1 = 5. 
    Now by division right ward from the left by ‘5’. 
    1 / 49  =  .10 - - - - - - - - - - - -(divide 1 by 50) 
 
     = .02 - - - - - - - - - (divide 2 by 5, 0 times, 2 remainder ) 
 
     = .0220 - - - - - - --(divide 20 by 5, 4 times) 
 
     = .0204 - - - - - - -( divide 4 by 5, 0 times, 4 remainder ) 
 
     = .020440 -- - -- - ( divide 40 by 5, 8 times ) 
 
     = .020408 - - - - - (divide 8 by 5, 1 time, 3 remainder ) 
 
     = .02040831 - - - -(divide 31 by 5, 6 times, 1 remainder ) 
 
     = .02040811 6 - - - - - - -    continue

               = .0204081613322615306111222244448 - -- - - - - 
 
   On completing 21 digits, we get 48 
i.e.,,Denominator - Numerator = 49 – 1 = 48 stands. 
i.e, half of the process stops here. The remaining half can be obtained as 
complements from 9. 
                                 . 
         Thus 1 / 49 = 0.020408163265306122448 
                                                                     . 
                                 979591836734693877551 
   Now finding 1 / 49 by process of multiplication left ward from right by 5, we 
get 
        1 / 49 =  ----------------------------------------------1 
                  =  ---------------------------------------------51 
                  =  -------------------------------------------2551 
                  =  ------------------------------------------27551 
                  =  ---- 483947294594118333617233446943383727551 
     i.e.,,Denominator – Numerator = 49 – 1 = 48 is obtained as 5X9+3 
  ( Carry over ) = 45 + 3 = 48. Hence half of the process is over. The remaining 
half is    automatically obtained as complements of 9. 
 
    Thus 1 / 49 = ---------------979591836734693877551 
                               . 
                         = 0.020408163265306122448 
                                                                   .

   Example 2:  Find 1 / 39 by Ekadhika process. 
 
   Now by multiplication method, Ekadhikena purva is 3 + 1 = 4 
 
       1 / 39 =  -------------------------------------1 
                = -------------------------------------41 
                = ----------------------------------1641

               = --------------------------------225641 
               = -------------------------------1025641 
 Here the repeating block happens to be block of 6 digits. Now the rule 
predicting the completion of half of the computation does not hold. The 
complete block has to be computed by ekadhika process.  
 
     Now continue and obtain the result. Find reasons for the non–applicability of 
the said ‘rule’. 
 
 Find the recurring decimal form of the fractions 1 / 29, 1 / 59, 
1 / 69, 1 / 79, 1 / 89 using Ekadhika process if possible. Judge whether 
the rule of completion of half the computation   holds good in such cases.
 
Note : The Ekadhikena Purvena sutra can also be used for conversion of vulgar 
fractions ending in 1, 3, 7 such as 1 / 11, 1 / 21, 1 / 31 - - -- ,1 / 13, 1 / 23, - - 
- -, 1 / 7, 1 / 17, - - - - - by writing them in the following way and solving them.

2. Nikhilam navatascaramam Dasatah 
The formula simply means : “all from 9 and the last from 10” 
The formula can be very effectively applied in multiplication of numbers, which 
are nearer to bases like 10, 100, 1000i.e., to the powers of 10 . The procedure 
of multiplication using the Nikhilam involves minimum number of steps, space, 
time saving and only mental calculation. The numbers taken can be either less 
or more than the base considered. 
The difference between the number and the base is termed as deviation. 
Deviation may be positive or negative. Positive deviation is written without the 
positive sign and the negative deviation, is written using Rekhank (a bar on the 
number). Now observe the following table.

    Some rules of the method (near to the base) in Multiplication  
a) Since deviation is obtained by Nikhilam sutra we call the method as Nikhilam 
multiplication. 
Eg : 94. Now deviation can be obtained by ‘all from 9 and the last from 10’ 
sutrai.e., the last digit 4 is from 10 and remaining digit 9 from 9 gives 06. 
b) The two numbers under consideration are written one below the other. The 
deviations are written on the right hand side.  
Eg : Multiply 7 by 8. 
 
     Now the base is 10. Since it is near to both the numbers, 
                                                                                           7 
     we write the numbers one below the other.                       8

      Take the deviations of both the numbers from 
     the base and represent                                                       _

 or remainders 3 and 2 implies that the numbers to be multiplied are both less

c) The product or answer will have two parts, one on the left side and the other 
on the right. A vertical or a slant linei.e., a slash may be drawn for the 
demarcation of the two parts i.e., 
              
             (or)               
          
d) The R.H.S. of the answer is the product of the deviations of the numbers. It 
shall contain the number of digits equal to number of zeroes in the base. 
                                 _  
                   i.e.,  7    3

            Since base is 10, 6 can be taken as it is. 
e) L.H.S of the answer is the sum of one number with the deviation of the 
other. It can be arrived at in any one of the four ways. 
 
i) Cross-subtract deviation 2 on the second row from the original number7 in 
the first row i.e., 7-2 = 5. 
 
ii) Cross–subtract deviation 3 on the first row from the original number8 in the

20 
 
second row (converse way of(i)) 
i.e., 8 - 3 = 5 
 
iii) Subtract the base 10 from the sum of the given numbers. 
i.e., (7 + 8) – 10 = 5 
   iv) Subtract the sum of the two deviations from the base. 
        i.e., 10 – ( 3 + 2) = 5 
             Hence 5 is left hand side of the answer. 
                                             _ 
                            Thus     7    3

f) If R.H.S. contains less number of digits than the number of zeros in the base, 
the remaining digits are filled up by giving zero or zeroes on the left side of the 
R.H.S. If the number of digits are more than the number of zeroes in the base, 
the excess digit or digits are to be added to L.H.S of the answer.  
The general form of the multiplication under Nikhilam can be shown as follows : 
Let N1 and N2 be two numbers near to a given base in powers of 10, andD1 and 
D2 are their respective deviations from the base. ThenN1 X N2 can be 
represented as 
                   
 
Case (i) : Both the numbers are lower than the base.We have already 
considered the example 7 x 8 , with base 10.

21 
 
Now let us solve some more examples by taking bases 100 and 1000 
respectively.  
Ex. 1: Find 97 X 94. Here base is 100. Now following the rules, the working is 
as follows: 
                   
 
  
Ex. 2:  98 X 97 Base is 100. 
                     
 
Ex. 3: 75X95. Base is 100. 
                   
 
Ex. 4: 986 X 989. Base is 1000. 
                   
 
Ex. 5: 994X988. Base is 1000.

Ex. 6: 750X995. 
                   
 
Case ( ii) : Both the numbers are higher than the base. 
The method and rules follow as they are. The only difference is the positive 
deviation. Instead of cross – subtract, we follow cross – add. 
Ex. 7: 13X12. Base is 10 
                   
 
Ex. 8: 18X14. Base is 10. 
                   
 
Ex. 9: 104X102. Base is 100.

                           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

                             1004   004 
                           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                              1279/ 275x4   =    1279 / 1100     ( rule -f ) 
                           ____________    =    1280100  
Case ( iii ): One number is more and the other is less than the base. 
In this situation one deviation is positive and the other is negative. So the 
product of deviations becomes negative. So the right hand side of the answer 
obtained will therefore have to be subtracted. To have a clear representation 
and understanding a vinculum is used. It proceeds into normalization. 
Ex.11: 13X7. Base is 10 
                   
 
Note : Conversion of common number into vinculum number and vice versa.

                 98 = 100 – 2  = 102 
                                            _ 
               196 = 200 – 4  = 204

                   _ 
               322 = 300 – 22 = 278. etc  
The procedure can be explained in detail using Nikhilam Navatascaram Dasatah, 
Ekadhikenapurvena, Ekanyunena purvena in the foregoing pages of this book.] 
Ex. 12: 108 X 94. Base is 100.

Ex. 13: 998 X 1025. Base is 1000. 
               
 
Algebraic Proof: 
Case ( i ):  
     Let the two numbers N1 and N2 be less than the selected base say x.  
N1 = (x-a), N2 = (x-b). Here a and b are the corresponding deviations of the 
numbersN1 and N2 from the base x. Observe that x is a multiple of 10.  
    Now N1 X N2   = (x-a) (x-b)  =  x.x  – x.b –  a.x  +  ab  
                 = x (x – a – b ) + ab. [rule – e(iv), d ] 
                 = x [(x – a) – b] + ab = x (N1–b) + ab[rule–e(i),d]  
           or   = x [(x – b) – a] = x (N2 – a) + ab. [rule –e (ii),d] 
                    x (x – a – b) + ab can also be written as  
 x[(x – a) + (x – b) – x] + ab = x[N1+N2 – x] + ab [rule –e(iii),d]. 
A difficult can be faced, if the vertical multiplication of the deficit digits or 
deviationsi.e., a.b yields a product consisting of more than the required digits. 
Then rule-f will enable us to surmount the difficulty.  
Case ( ii ) : 
When both the numbers exceed the selected base, we have N1 = x + a,N2 = x + 
b, x being the base. Now the identity (x+a) (x+b) = x(x+a+b) + a.b holds 
good, of course with relevant details mentioned in case(i).

25 
 
Case ( iii ) : 
When one number is less and another is more than the base, we can use (x-
a)(x+b) = x(x–a+ b)–ab. and the procedure is evident from the examples 
given.

Nikhilam in Division  
Consider some two digit numbers (dividends) and same divisor 9. Observe the 
following example.  
        i)  13 ÷ 9 The quotient (Q) is 1, Remainder (R) is 4. 
                           since 9  )  13  ( 1 
 
                                                9 
                                             ____ 
                                               4  
         ii)     34 ÷ 9, Q is 3, R is 7.  
         iii)    60 ÷ 9, Q is 6, R is 6.  
         iv)    80 ÷ 9, Q is 8, R is 8. 
Now we have another type of representation for the above examples as given 
hereunder: 
i) Split each dividend into a left hand part for the Quotient and right - hand part 
for the remainder by a slant line or slash. 
Eg.     13 as 1 / 3,     34 as 3 / 4 ,    80 as 8 / 0. 
ii) Leave some space below such representation, draw a horizontal line.

26 
 
Eg.         1 / 3            3 / 4             8 / 0 
                ______   ,      ______  ,    ______ 
iii) Put the first digit of the dividend as it is under the horizontal line. Put the 
same digit under the right hand part for the remainder, add the two and place 
the sumi.e., sum of the digits of the numbers as the remainder.  
Eg. 
                     1 / 3         3 / 4        8 / 0 
                          1             3              8 
                    ______  ,   ______ ,  ______  
                     1 / 4         3 / 7        8 / 8  
      Now the problem is over. i.e.,  
      13 ÷ 9 gives Q = 1, R = 4 
      34 ÷ 9 gives Q = 3, R = 7 
      80 ÷ 9 gives Q = 8, R = 8 
Proceeding for some more of the two digit number division by 9, we get  
             a) 21 ÷ 9  as 
                               9)  2 /  1     i.e     Q=2, R=3 
                                            2 
                                    ‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                     2  /  3 
 
             b)  43 ÷ 9  as 
                               9)  4  /  3     i.e    Q = 4, R = 7. 
                                          4 
                                   ‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                    4  /  7  
The examples given so far convey that in the division of two digit numbers by 9, 
we canmechanically take the first digit down for the quotient – column and that, 
by adding the quotient to the second digit, we can get the remainder.  
Now in the case of 3 digit numbers, let us proceed as follows.  
i) 
                   9  )  104  ( 11                9 ) 10   /  4 
                            99                               1  /  1

27 
 
                       ‾‾‾‾‾‾            as           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                            5                               11 /  5 
ii) 
                   9  )  212  ( 23                9  )  21  /  2  
                          207                               2  /  3 
                        ‾‾‾‾‾             as           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                            5                              23  /  5  
iii) 
                   9  )  401  (44                9  )  40  /  1 
                          396                                4  /  4 
                        ‾‾‾‾‾            as           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                            5                               44 /  5 
Note that the remainder is the sum of the digits of the dividend. The first digit 
of the dividend from left is added mechanically to the second digit of the 
dividend to obtain the second digit of the quotient. This digit added to the third 
digit sets the remainder. The first digit of the dividend remains as the first digit 
of the quotient.  
Consider    511  ÷  9 
Add the first digit 5 to second digit 1 getting 5 + 1 = 6. Hence Quotient is 56. 
Now second digit of 56 i.e., 6 is added to third digit 1 of dividend to get the 
remainder i.e., 1 + 6 = 7 
Thus 
                   9 )     51  /  1 
                              5 /  6 
                            ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                            56  /  7  
               Q is 56, R is 7.  
Extending the same principle even to bigger numbers of still more digits, we can 
get the results.  
Eg : 1204 ÷ 9 
i) Add first digit 1 to the second digit 2. 1 + 2 = 3 
 
ii) Add the second digit of quotient 13. i.e., 3 to third digit ‘0’ and obtain the 
Quotient. 3 + 0 = 3, 133

28 
 
iii) Add the third digit of Quotient 133 i.e.,3 to last digit ‘4’ of the dividend and 
write the final Quotient and Remainder. R = 3 + 4 = 7, Q = 133 
   In symbolic form        9 )  120  /  4  
                                               13  /  3 
                                            ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                           133  /  7 
Another example.  
                                   9 ) 13210   / 1         132101 ÷ 9  
               gives  
                                         1467   /  7         Q = 14677, R = 8 
                                        ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾   
                                         14677  /  8 
In all the cases mentioned above, the remainder is less than the divisor. What 
about the case when the remainder is equal or greater than the divisor? 
Eg. 
                   9 )  3  /  6             9)   24  /  6  
                               3                     2  /   6  
                        ‾‾‾‾‾‾        or       ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                       3  /  9 (equal)          26 / 12 (greater).  
We proceed by re-dividing the remainder by 9, carrying over this Quotient to 
the quotient side and retaining the final remainder in the remainder side.  
             9 )  3  /  6                 9 ) 24  /  6 
                           /  3                        2  /  6 
                       ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                       3  /  9                      26  /  12 
                       ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                       4  /  0                      27  /   3 
             Q = 4,       R = 0        Q = 27,       R = 3. 
When the remainder is greater than divisor, it can also be represented as 
                           9 )  24  /  6 
                                       2  /  6 
                                     ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                     26 /1 / 2 
                                             / 1 
                                    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                       1    / 3

29 
 
                                    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                      27   / 3 
Now consider the divisors of two or more digits whose last digit is 9,when 
divisor is 89. 
We Know         113 = 1 X 89 + 24,        Q =1,     R = 24 
                  10015 = 112 X 89 + 47,     Q = 112, R = 47.  
Representing in the previous form of procedure, we have 
               89 )  1  /  13                89 ) 100  / 15 
                               /   11                       12  /  32 
                           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾                   ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                           1  /  24                        112  /  47 
But how to get these? What is the procedure? 
Now Nikhilam rule comes to rescue us. The nikhilam states “all from 9 and the 
last from 10”. Now if you want to find 113 ÷ 89, 10015 ÷ 89, you have to apply 
nikhilam formula on 89 and get the complement 11.Further while carrying the 
added numbers to the place below the next digit, we have to multiply by this 
11. 
           89 )  1  /  13         89 )  100  /15 
                                          ‾‾ 
                          /  11         11      11  /           first digit 1 x 11 
                     ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾  
                       1  /  24                   1 /  1     total second is 1x11 
                                                            22   total of 3rd digit is 2 x 11 
                                                ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                                 112  /  47 
What is 10015 ÷ 98 ? Apply Nikhilam and get 100 – 98 = 02. Set off the 2 
digits from the right as the remainder consists of 2 digits. While carrying the 
added numbers to the place below the next digit, multiply by 02.  
Thus 
                   98  )   100   /  15 
                    ‾‾ 
                    02       02  /                i.e., 10015 ÷ 98 gives  
                                0  /   0             Q = 102,     R = 19 
                                   /    04 
                            ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾    
                            102   /  19

30 
 
In the same way 
                           897 )  11  /  422 
                           ‾‾‾ 
                           103      1  /  03 
                                         /   206 
                                    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                     12 /  658 
gives     11,422 ÷ 897,    Q = 12, R=658. 
In this way we have to multiply the quotient by 2 in the case of 8, by 3 in the 
case of 7, by 4 in the case of 6 and so on. i.e., multiply the Quotient digit by the 
divisors complement from 10. In case of more digited numbers we apply 
Nikhilam and proceed. Any how, this method is highly useful and effective for 
division when the numbers are near to bases of 10. 
 
  * Guess the logic in the process of division by 9. 
 * Obtain the Quotient and Remainder for the following problems. 
 
          1) 311 ÷ 9             2) 120012 ÷ 9            3) 1135 ÷ 97 
 
         4) 2342 ÷ 98           5) 113401 ÷ 997  
 
         6) 11199171 ÷ 99979 
 
Observe that by nikhilam process of division, even lengthier divisions involve no 
division or no subtraction but only a few multiplications of single digits with 
small numbers and a simple addition. But we know fairly well that only a special 
type of cases are being dealt and hence many questions about various other 
types of problems arise. The answer lies in Vedic Methods.

3. Urdhva - tiryagbhyam  
Urdhva – tiryagbhyam is the general formula applicable to all cases of 
multiplication and also in the division of a large number by another large 
number. It means  
(a) Multiplication of two 2 digit numbers.  
Ex.1:  Find the product 14 X 12 
 
i) The right hand most digit of the multiplicand, the first number (14) i.e.,4 is 
multiplied by the right hand most digit of the multiplier, the second number 
(12)i.e., 2. The product 4 X 2 = 8 forms the right hand most part of the answer.  
 
ii) Now, diagonally multiply the first digit of the multiplicand (14) i.e., 4 and 
second digit of the multiplier (12)i.e., 1 (answer 4 X 1=4); then multiply the 
second digit of the multiplicand i.e.,1 and first digit of the multiplier i.e., 2 
(answer 1 X 2 = 2); add these two i.e.,4 + 2 = 6. It gives the next, i.e., second 
digit of the answer. Hence second digit of the answer is 6.  
 
iii) Now, multiply the second digit of the multiplicand i.e., 1 and second digit of 
the multiplieri.e., 1 vertically, i.e., 1 X 1 = 1. It gives the left hand most part of 
the answer.  
 
Thus the answer is 16 8. 
Symbolically we can represent the process as follows : 
                         
 
The symbols are operated from right to left . 
  
     Step i) :

32 
 
                               
 
Step ii) : 
 
                            
 
Step iii) : 
 
                       
 
 
      Now in the same process, answer can be written as 
 
                              23 
                                   13 
                         ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                         2 : 6 + 3 : 9  =  299     (Recall the 3 steps) 
 
Ex.3 
                                   41 
                                X 41 
                         ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾    
                         16 : 4 + 4 : 1 = 1681.

What happens when one of the results i.e., either in the last digit or in the 
middle digit of the result, contains more than 1 digit ? Answer is simple. The 
right – hand – most digit there of is to be put down there and the 
preceding,i.e., left –hand –side digit or digits should be carried over to the left 
and placed under the previous digit or digits of the upper row. The digits carried 
over may be written as in Ex. 4.  
 
Ex.4:        32 X 24 
 
Step (i) :    2 X 4 = 8 
 
Step (ii) :    3 X 4 = 12; 2 X 2 = 4; 12 + 4 = 16. 
 
Here 6 is to be retained. 1 is to be carried out to left side. 
 
Step (iii) :    3 X 2 = 6. Now the carried over digit 1 of 16 is to be added. 
                       i.e., 6 + 1 = 7. 
 
Thus 32 X 24 = 768 
 
We can write it as follows  
                                           32 
                                           24 
                                         ‾‾‾‾   
                                          668 
                                          1 
                                         ‾‾‾‾   
                                          768.

34 
 
Note that the carried over digit from the result (3X4) + (2X2) = 12+4 = 16 
i.e.,1 is placed under the previous digit 3 X 2 = 6 and added.  
After sufficient practice, you feel no necessity of writing in this way and simply 
operate or perform mentally.  
 
Ex.5        28 X 35. 
Step (i) :     8 X 5 = 40. 0 is retained as the first digit of the answer and 4 is 
carried  over. 
 
Step (ii) :    2 X 5 = 10; 8 X 3 = 24; 10 + 24 = 34; add the carried over 4 to 
34. Now the result is 34 + 4 = 38. Now 8 is retained as the second digit of the 
answer and3   is carried over.  
 
Step (iii) :    2 X 3 = 6; add the carried over 3 to 6. The result 6 + 3 = 9 is the 
third or final digit from right to left of the answer. 
 
Thus 28 X 35 = 980. 
Ex.6  
                                48 
                                47 
                             ‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                              1606 
                                65 
                             ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                              2256  
Step (i):     8 X 7 = 56; 5, the carried over digit is placed below the second 
digit. 
 
 
Step (ii):     ( 4 X 7) + (8 X 4) = 28 + 32 = 60; 6, the carried over digit is 
placed below the third digit. 
 
Step (iii):     Respective digits are added. 
 
Algebraic proof : 
    a) Let the two 2 digit numbers be (ax+b) and (cx+d). Note that x = 10. Now 
consider the product

35 
 
 
      (ax + b) (cx + d)  =  ac.x2 + adx + bcx + b.d  
 
                               =  ac.x2 + (ad + bc)x + b.d  
 
Observe that  
i) The first term i.e., the coefficient of x2 (i.e., 100, hence the digit in the100th 
place) is obtained by vertical multiplication of a and c i.e.,the digits in10th place 
(coefficient of x) of both the numbers; 
 
ii) The middle term, i.e., the coefficient of x (i.e., digit in the 10th place) is 
obtained by cross wise multiplication of a and d; and of b and c; and the 
addition of the two products; 
 
iii) The last (independent of x) term is obtained by vertical multiplication of the 
independent terms b and d. 
b) Consider the multiplication of two 3 digit numbers.  
 
Let the two numbers be(ax2 + bx + c) and (dx2 + ex + f). Note that x=10 
 
Now the product is 
                           ax2 + bx + c 
 
                         x dx2 + ex + f 
         ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
        ad.x4+bd.x3+cd.x2+ae.x3+be.x2+ce.x+af.x2+bf.x+cf 
 
= ad.x4 + (bd + ae). x3 + (cd + be + af).x2 + (ce + bf)x + cf

36 
 
Note the following points : 
 i)  The coefficient of x4 , i.e., ad is obtained by the vertical multiplication of the 
firstcoefficient from the left side : 
                        
 
ii)The coefficient of x3 , i.e., (ae + bd) is obtained by the cross –wise 
multiplication of the first two coefficients and by the addition of the two 
products; 
 
                       
 
iii)  The coefficient of x2 is obtained by the multiplication of the first coefficient 
of the multiplicand(ax2+bx +c) i.e., a; by the last coefficient of the multiplier 
(dx2 +ex +f)i.e.,f ; of the middle one i.e., b of the multiplicand by the middle 
one i.e., e of the multiplier and of the last onei.e., c of the multiplicand by the 
first one i.e., d of the multiplier and by the addition of all the three productsi.e., 
af + be +cd : 
 
                        
 
iv) The coefficient of x is obtained by the cross wise multiplication of the second 
coefficienti.e., b of the multiplicand by the third one i.e., f of the multiplier, and 
conversely the third coefficienti.e., c of the multiplicand by the second 
coefficient i.e., e of the multiplier and by addition of the two products,i.e., bf + 
ce ;

37 
 
                       
    
v) And finally the last (independent of x) term is obtained by the vertical 
multiplication of the last coefficients c and f i.e., cf 
 
                     
 
Thus the process can be put symbolically as (from left to right) 
 
                    
 
 
Consider the following example  
 
                           124 X 132. 
Proceeding from right to left  
i) 4 X 2 = 8. First digit = 8 
 
ii) (2 X 2) + (3 X 4) = 4 + 12 = 16. The digit 6 is retained and 1 is carried over 
to left side. Second digit = 6. 
 
iii) (1 X 2) + (2 X 3) + (1 X 4) = 2 + 6 + 4 =12. The carried over 1 of above 
step is added i.e., 12 + 1 = 13. Now 3 is retained and 1 is carried over to left

38 
 
side. Thus third digit = 3. 
 
iv) ( 1X 3 ) + ( 2 X 1 ) = 3 + 2 = 5. the carried over 1 of above step is added 
i.e., 5 + 1 = 6 . It is retained. Thus fourth digit = 6 
 
v) ( 1 X 1 ) = 1. As there is no carried over number from the previous step it is 
retained. Thus fifth digit = 1 
 
                   124 X 132 = 16368. 
Let us work another problem by placing the carried over digits under the first 
row and proceed. 
                            234 
                              x 316 
                              ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                               61724 
                                1222 
                              ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                               73944 
i) 4 X 6 = 24 : 2, the carried over digit is placed below the second digit. 
 
ii) (3 X 6) + (4 x 1) = 18 + 4 = 22 ; 2, the carried over digit is placed below 
third digit. 
 
iii) (2 X 6) + (3 X 1) + (4 X 3) = 12 + 3 + 12 = 27 ; 2, the carried over digit is 
placed below fourth digit. 
 
iv) (2 X 1) + ( 3 X 3) = 2 + 9 = 11; 1, the carried over digit is placed below 
fifth digit. 
 
v) ( 2 X 3 ) = 6. 
 
vi) Respective digits are added. 
Note :  
1. We can carry out the multiplication in urdhva - tiryak process from left to 
right or right to left. 
 
2. The same process can be applied even for numbers having more digits. 
 
3. urdhva –tiryak process of multiplication can be effectively used in 
multiplication regarding algebraic expressions.

Urdhva – tiryak in converse for division process: 
 
As per the statement it an used as a simple argumentation for division process 
particularly in algebra.  
 
Consider the division of (x3 +5x2 + 3x + 7) by (x – 2)process by converse of 
urdhva – tiryak : 
 
    i)   x3 divided by x gives                       x2 . x3 + 5x2 + 3x + 7 
              It is the first term of the Quotient.   ___________________  
                                                                         x – 2 
                              Q = x2 + - - - - - - - - - - - 
ii)   x2 X – 2 = - 2x2 . But 5x2 in the dividend hints7x2 more since 7x2 – 2x2 = 
5x2 . This ‘more’ can be obtained from the multiplication of x by 7x. Hence 
second term of Q is 7x.  
       x3 + 5x2 + 3x + 7  
          ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾   gives Q = x2 + 7x + - - - - - - - -  
                     x – 2 
 
iii)We now have – 2 X 7x = -14x. But the 3rd term in the dividend is 3x for 
which ‘17x more’ is required since 17x – 14x =3x.  
 
Now multiplication of x by 17 gives 17x. Hence third term of quotient is 17

41 
 
        Thus 
                   x3 + 5x2 + 3x + 7  
                 _________________    gives Q= x2 + 7x +17 
                           x – 2 
 
iv) Now last term of Q, i.e., 17 multiplied by –2 gives 17X–2 = -34 but the 
relevant term in dividend is 7. So 7 + 34 = 41 ‘more’ is required. As there no 
more terms left in dividend, 41 remains as the remainder. 
 
             x3 + 5x2 + 3x + 7 
          ________________   gives Q=x2 + 7x +17 and R = 41. 
                     x – 2  
 
Find the Q and R in the following divisions by using the converse 
process of urdhva – tiryagbhyam method : 
 
1)  3x2 – x – 6                        2) 16x2 + 24x +9

3)  x3+ 2x2 +3x + 5             4) 12x4 – 3x2 – 3x + 12

             x - 3                                         x2 + 1 
 
4. Paravartya Yojayet  
'Paravartya – Yojayet' means 'transpose and apply' 
(i) Consider the division by divisors of more than one digit, and when the 
divisors are slightly greater than powers of 10.  
Example 1 : Divide 1225 by 12. 
Step 1 :  (From left to right ) write the Divisor leaving the first digit, write the 
other digit or digits using negative (-) sign and place them below the divisor 
as shown.  
 
               12 
               -2 
               ‾‾‾‾  
Step 2 : Write down the dividend to the right. Set apart the last digit for the 
remainder.

42 
 
            i.e.,,     12     122     5 
                      - 2 
 
Step 3 : Write the 1st digit below the horizontal line drawn under 
thedividend. Multiply the digit by –2, write the product below the 2nd digit 
and add.  
 
           i.e.,,     12     122    5 
                      -2      -2 
                    ‾‾‾‾‾  ‾‾‾‾  
                                10 
 
            Since 1 x –2 = -2and 2 + (-2) = 0 
 
Step 4 : We get second digits’ sum as ‘0’. Multiply the second digits’ sum 
thus obtained by –2 and writes the product under 3rd digit and add. 
 
                   12             122     5 
                  - 2              -20  
                  ‾‾‾‾        ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                   102       5 
 
Step 5 : Continue the process to the last digit. 
 
                       i.e.,     12        122      5 
                                 - 2          -20    -4  
                                ‾‾‾‾‾     ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                               102      1  
 
Step 6: The sum of the last digit is the Remainder and the result to its left is 
Quotient.  
Thus Q = 102 andR = 1 
Example 2 :     Divide     1697 by 14. 
 
                               14         1 6 9  7 
                              - 4          -4–8–4 
                              ‾‾‾‾       ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                           1 2 1  3 
 
                                Q = 121, R = 3. 
Example 3 :     Divide     2598 by 123. 
 
        Note that the divisor has 3 digits. So we have to set up the last two

43 
 
digits of the dividend for the remainder. 
 
                       1 2 3            25     98     Step ( 1 ) & Step ( 2 ) 
                        -2-3 
                       ‾‾‾‾‾           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
            Now proceed the sequence of steps write –2 and –3 as follows : 
 
                                  1 2 3            25     98  
                                   -2-3             -4    -6 
                                  ‾‾‾‾‾                  -2–3 
                                                     ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                                      21     1 5 
 
            Since    2 X (-2, -3)= -4 , -6;5 – 4 = 1  
                       and (1 X (-2,-3); 9 – 6 – 2 = 1; 8 – 3 = 5. 
            Hence Q = 21 and R = 15. 
Example 4 : Divide 239479 by 11213. The divisor has 5 digits. So the last 
4digits of the dividend are to be set up for Remainder. 
 
                           1 1213         2 3    9  4 7 9

                          ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾                -1-2-1-3      with 1 
                                                ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

                           Hence Q = 21, R = 4006. 
Example 5 :  Divide   13456 by 1123 
 
                           1 12  3            1 3 4  5         6

                                                   ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                                   1 2 0–2        0 
Note that the remainder portion contains –20, i.e.,, a negative quantity. To 
over come this situation, take 1 over from the quotient column, i.e.,, 1123 
over to the right side, subtract the remainder portion 20 to get the actual 
remainder.  
Thus Q = 12 – 1 = 11, and R = 1123 - 20 = 1103.

      Find the Quotient and Remainder for the problems using 
paravartya – yojayet method. 
          1) 1234 ÷ 112              2) 11329 ÷ 1132 
          3) 12349÷ 133            4) 239479÷1203  
 
Now let us consider the application of paravartya – yojayet in algebra.  
Example 1 :     Divide     6x2 + 5x + 4 by x – 1 
 
                           X- 1         6x2 + 5x + 4 
                          ‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                              1                   6+ 11 
                                          ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                           6x  + 11 + 15    ThusQ = 6x+11,R=15. 
Example 2 :     Divide     x3 –3x2 + 10x – 4 by x - 5 
 
                           X- 5         x3 – 3x2 + 10x –   4 
                           ‾‾‾‾‾       
                              5                 5     + 10     100  
                                            ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                             x2 + 2x + 20, + 96 
                       Thus Q= x2 + 2x + 20, R = 96. 
The procedure as a mental exercise comes as follows : 
i) x3 / xgives x2 i.e.,, 1 the first coefficient in the Quotient. 
 
ii) Multiply 1 by + 5,(obtained after reversing the sign of second term in the 
Quotient) and add to the next coefficient in the dividend. It gives 1 X( +5) = 
+5, adding to the next coefficient, i.e.,, –3 + 5 = 2. This is next coefficient in 
Quotient. 
 
iii) Continue the process : multiply 2 by +5, i.e.,, 2 X +5 =10, add to the 
next coefficient 10 + 10 = 20. This is next coefficient in Quotient. Thus 
Quotient is x2 + 2x + 20 
 
iv) Nowmultiply 20 by + 5i.e.,, 20 x 5 = 100. Add to the next (last) term,  
100 + (-4) = 96, which becomesR,i.e.,, R =9.

Example 3: 
                               x4 –3x3 + 7x2 + 5x + 7 
                             ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                        x + 4  
 
        Now thinking the method as in example ( 1 ), we proceed as follows. 
 
                   x + 4         x4 - 3x3 +7x2 + 5x  +    7 
                   ‾‾‾‾‾ 
                     -4               - 4  + 28 -  140  +  540 
                                   ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                   x3 - 7x2 + 35x - 135   547 
      Thus Q = x3 – 7x2 + 35x – 135 and R = 547. 
 
           or we proceed orally as follows: 
      x4 / x gives 1 as first coefficient.  
i) -4 X 1 = - 4 : add to next coefficient – 4 + (-3) = - 7 which gives next 
coefficient in Q. 
 
ii) – 7 X - 4 = 28 : then 28 + 7 = 35, the next coefficient in Q. 
 
iii) 35 X - 4 = - 140 : then – 140 + 5 = - 135, the next coefficient in Q. 
 
iv) - 135 X - 4 = 540 : then 540 + 7 = 547 becomes R. 
    Thus Q = x3 – 7x2 + 35x – 135 , R = 547. 
Note :  
1. We can follow the same procedure even the number of terms is more.  
2. If any term is missing, we have to take the coefficient of the term as zero 
and proceed.  
Now consider the divisors of second degree or more as in the following 
example. 
Example :4     2x4 – 3x3 – 3x + 2 by x2 + 1. 
 
        Here x2 term is missing in the dividend. Hence treat it as 0 .x2 or 0 . 
And the x term in divisor is also absent we treat it as 0 . x. Now

46 
 
            
    x2             + 1             2x4 -3x3 + 0 . x2 - 3x + 2 
               x2+ 0 . x + 1                     0    - 2 
               ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                      0      - 1                               0      + 3 
                                                                            0   + 2 
                                               ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                                2   - 3     - 2         0       4 
        Thus Q = 2x2 - 3x - 2andR = 0 . x + 4 = 4. 
Example 5 :     2x5 – 5x4 + 3x2 – 4x + 7by x3 – 2x2 + 3. 
 
        We treat the dividend as 2x5 –5x4 + 0. x3 + 3x2 – 4x + 7 and divisor as 
x3 –2x2 + 0 . x + 3 and proceed as follows : 
 
               x3 – 2x2 + 0 . x + 3      2x5 – 5x4 +  0.x3 + 3x2 – 4x + 7 
               ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                      2        0      - 3               4         0     - 6 
                                                                    -2         0   +  3 
                                                                              - 4       0  +  6 
                                                ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                                    2   -    1     - 2      - 7   - 1   +13 
        Thus Q = 2x2 – x – 2, R = - 7x2 – x + 13. 
You may observe a very close relation of the method paravartya in this 
aspect with regard to REMAINDER THEOREM and HORNER PROCESS of 
Synthetic division. And yet paravartya goes much farther and is capable of 
numerous applications in other directions also.  
 
Apply paravartya – yojayet to find out the Quotient and Remainder in 
each of the following    problems. 
 
    1) (4x2 + 3x + 5)÷(x+1) 
    2) (x3 – 4x2 + 7x + 6) ÷ (x – 2) 
    3) (x4 – x3 + x2 + 2x + 4) ÷(x2 - x – 1) 
    4) (2x5 +x3 – 3x + 7) ÷ (x3 + 2x – 3) 
    5) (7x6 + 6x5 – 5x4 + 4x3 –3x2 + 2x – 1)÷ (x-1)

47 
 
Paravartya in solving simple equations : 
Recall that 'paravartya yojayet' means 'transpose and apply'. The rule 
relating to transposition enjoins invariable change of sign with every change 
of side. i.e., + becomes - and conversely ; and X becomes ÷ and conversely. 
Further it can be extended to the transposition of terms from left to right and 
conversely and from numerator to denominator and conversely in the 
concerned problems. 
Type ( i ) : 
                           Consider the problem 7x – 5  = 5x + 1 
                                                        7x – 5x = 1 + 5  
                                                                i.e.,,   2x = 6   x = 6 ÷ 2 = 3. 
Observe that the problem is of the type ax + b = cx + d from which we get 
by ‘transpose’ (d – b), (a – c) and  
 
                                  d - b. 
                     x =      ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                  a - c 
In this example a = 7, b = - 5, c = 5, d = 1  
Hence                     1 – (- 5)          1+5         6     
                   x  =     _______    =  ____   =   __   =    3 
                                 7 – 5            7-5           2     
 
 
Example 2:     Solve for x,3x + 4 = 2x + 6 
 
                                   d - b            6 - 4           2      
                       x  =      _____    =  _____     =   __   =   2 
                                   a - c            3 - 2           1  
Type ( ii ) :Consider problems of the type (x + a) (x+b) = (x+c) (x+d). By 
paravartya, we get  
                                            cd - ab  
                       x        =      ______________ 
                                           (a + b) – (c + d)

48 
 
It is trivial form the following steps  
                       (x + a) (x + b) = (x + c) (x + d) 
                       x2 + bx + ax + ab  = x2 + dx + cx + cd 
                         bx + ax – dx – cx = cd – ab  
                          x( a + b – c – d) = cd – ab 
                              cd – ab                                     cd - ab 
               x   =     ____________        x    =    _________________ 
                           a + b – c – d                        ( a + b ) – (c + d.)  
Example 1 : (x – 3) (x – 2 ) = (x + 1 ) (x + 2 ).  
By paravartya  
                              cd – ab               1 (2) – (-3) (-2) 
                 x=    __________   =       ______________ 
                           a + b – c –d            - 3 – 2 – 1 – 2 
 
                              2 - 6                   - 4          1 
                      =     _______    =       ___   =   __ 
                               - 8                     - 8          2 
Example 2 :     (x + 7) (x – 6) = (x +3) (x – 4).  
    Now                 cd - ab                        (3) (-4) – (7) (-6) 
                 x =     ___________     =      ________________ 
                            a + b – c – d               7 + (-6) – 3 - (-4) 
 
                               - 12 + 42                  30 
                      =    ____________     =   ___    =   15 
                            7 – 6 – 3 + 4                2 
Note that if cd - ab = 0 i.e.,, cd = ab, i.e.,, if the product of the absolute 
terms be the same on both sides, the numerator becomes zero giving x = 0.  
 For the problem (x + 4) (x + 3) = (x – 2 ) ( x – 6 ) 
 Solution is x = 0 since 4 X 3 = - 2 X - 6. = 12  
Type ( iii) : 
    Consider the problems of the type      ax + b          m 
                                                            ______    = __  
                                                             cx + d          n

49 
 
    By cross – multiplication,  
                                   n ( ax + b) = m (cx + d) 
                                   nax + nb = mcx + md 
                                   nax - mcx = md – nb  
                                   x( na – mc ) = md – nb 
 
                                            md - nb

                                            na - mc. 
    Now look at the problem once again  
                                     ax + b         m

                                     cx+ d          n 
paravartya gives         md - nb, na - mc    and 
                                                                          md - nb

                           m(b + c) + n(c+a) + p(a + b)

                                   ____    +  ____   -    ____    =   0 
                                   x + 4         x + 6        x + 5 
 
some more simple solutions : 
 
               m             n            m + n 
             ____   +   ____    =    _____ 
              x + a       x + b          x + c  
Now this can be written as,  
 
                m             n             m               n 
             ____   +   ____    =    _____   +   _____ 
             x + a        x + b          x + c        x + c  
            m            m             n                n 
             ____   -   ____   =     _____   -   _____ 
             x + a        x + c         x + c         x + b  
        m(x +c) – m(x + a)          n(x + b) – n(x + c) 
            ________________    =    ________________ 
              (x + a) (x + c)                (x + c) (x + b) 
 
 
        mx + mc – mx – ma          nx + nb – nx – nc 
            ________________    =    _______________ 
                (x + a) (x + c)             (x +c ) (x + b) 
                m (c – a)                        n (b –c) 
               ____________      =   ___________ 
                   x +a                            x + b 
       m (c - a).x + m (c - a).b    =    n (b - c). x + n(b - c).a 
            x [ m(c - a)- n(b - c) ]     =    na(b - c) – mb (c - a)  
        or x [ m(c - a) + n(c - b) ]    =    na(b - c) + mb (a - c)

53 
 
     
Thus                            mb(a - c) + na (b - c) 
                       x   =     ___________________ 
                                        m(c-a) + n(c-b). 
    By paravartya rule we can easily remember the formula.  
Example 1 :     solve  3 
 
5. Sunyam Samya Samuccaye 
The Sutra 'Sunyam Samyasamuccaye' says the 'Samuccaya is the same, that 
Samuccaya is Zero.' i.e., it should be equated to zero. The term 'Samuccaya' 
has several meanings under different contexts.  
i) We interpret, 'Samuccaya' as a term which occurs as a common factor in all 
the terms concerned and proceed as follows. 
Example 1: The equation 7x + 3x = 4x + 5x has the same factor ‘ x ‘ in all 
its terms. Hence by the sutra it is zero,i.e., x = 0. 
Otherwise we have to work like this:  
 
                   7x + 3x = 4x + 5x 
                        10x = 9x 
                 10x – 9x = 0 
                           x = 0 
    This is applicable not only for ‘x’ but also any such unknown quantity as 
follows. 
Example 2:      5(x+1) = 3(x+1) 
No need to proceed in the usual procedure like  
 
                       5x +  5 = 3x + 3 
                       5x – 3x =  3 – 5 
                   2x = -2     or     x = -2 ÷ 2 = -1 
    Simply think of the contextual meaning of 'Samuccaya'

54 
 
  
   Now Samuccaya is     ( x + 1) 
                                   x + 1 = 0     gives     x = -1  
ii) Now we interpret 'Samuccaya' as product of independent terms in 
expressions like (x+a) (x+b) 
Example 3:     ( x + 3 ) ( x + 4) = ( x – 2) ( x – 6 ) 
 
               Here Samuccaya is     3 x 4 = 12 = -2 x -6 
               Since it is same ,   we derive x = 0 
   This example, we have already dealt in type ( ii ) of Paravartya in solving 
simple equations. 
iii) We interpret ' Samuccaya 'as the sum of the denominators of two fractions 
having the same numerical numerator. 
Consider the example. 
 
                              1            1 
                           ____   +  ____   =   0 
                           3x-2        2x-1 
            for this we proceed by takingL.C.M. 
 
                   (2x-1)+(3x–2) 
                   ____________   =   0 
                   (3x–2)(2x–1) 
 
                         5x–3 
                   __________   =   0 
                   (3x–2)(2x–1) 
 
                       5x – 3 = 0        5x = 3 
 
                               3 
                       x  = __ 
                               5 
    Instead of this, we can directly put the Samuccaya i.e., sum of the 
denominators  
               i.e., 3x – 2 + 2x - 1 = 5x - 3 = 0

55 
 
               giving 5x = 3         x = 3 / 5 
    It is true and applicable for all problems of the type 
 
                   m           m 
                ____  +  _____   =   0 
                ax+b       cx+d 
    Samuccaya is ax+b+cx+d and solution is ( m ≠ 0 ) 
 
 
                       - ( b + d ) 
                x =   _________ 
                          ( a + c ) 
    iii) We now interpret 'Samuccaya' as combination or total. 
 
         If the sum of the numerators and the sum of the denominators be the 
same, then that sum = 0. 
 
    Consider examples of type  
 
                       ax+ b         ax + c 
                       _____  =   ______ 
                       ax+ c         ax + b 
        In this case,  (ax+b) (ax+b) =(ax+c) (ax+c) 
                       a2x2 + 2abx + b2 = a2x2 + 2acx +c2 
                                 2abx – 2acx = c2 – b2  
                             x ( 2ab – 2ac ) = c2 – b2 
 
                       c2–b2        (c+b)(c-b)      -(c+b) 
             x =   ______   =  _________  =   _____ 
                      2a(b-c)        2a(b-c)            2a 
            As per Samuccaya (ax+b) + (ax+c) = 0 
                                                    2ax+b+c = 0  
                                                        2ax = -b-c  
 
                                    -(c+b) 
                             x  =  ______ 
                                        2a            Hence the statement.

Example 4: 
                             3x+ 4        3x + 5 
                            ______  =   ______ 
                             3x+ 5        3x + 4 
        Since N1 + N2 = 3x + 4 + 3x + 5 = 6x + 9 , 
             And  D1 + D2 = 3x + 4 + 3x + 5 = 6x + 9 
             We haveN1 + N2 = D1 + D2 = 6x + 9 
                   Hence from Sunya Samuccaya we get 6x + 9 = 0 
                     6x = -9 
 
 
                                -9        -3 
                         x =  __   =   __ 
                                6          2 
Example 5: 
                        5x +7       5x + 12 
                        _____  =  _______ 
                        5x+12       5x + 7 
       Hence N1 + N2 = 5x + 7 + 5x + 12 = 10x + 19 
            And    D1 + D2 = 5x + 12 + 5x + 7 = 10x + 19 
                     N1 + N2 = D1 + D2 gives 10x + 19 = 0 
                                   10x = -19 
 
                                        -19 
                                 x  =  ____ 
                                          10 
Consider the examples of the type, where N1 + N2 = K (D1 + D2 ), where K is 
a numerical constant, then also by removing the numerical constant K, we 
can proceed as above. 
Example 6: 
 
                        2x + 3       x  + 1 
                        _____  =   ______ 
                       4x + 5        2x + 3 
        Here N1 + N2 = 2x + 3 + x + 1 = 3x + 4

57 
 
                   D1 + D2 = 4x + 5 + 2x + 3 = 6x + 8 
                                                            = 2 ( 3x + 4 ) 
        Removing the numerical factor 2, we get 3x + 4 on both sides. 
 
            3x + 4 = 0    3x = -4     x = - 4 / 3. 
v) 'Samuccaya' with the same meaning as above, i.e., case (iv), we solve the 
problems leading to quadratic equations. In this context, we take the 
problems as follows; 
       If N1 + N2 = D1 + D2 and also the differences 
               N1 ~ D1 = N2 ~ D2 then both the things are equated to zero, the 
solution gives the two values for x. 
Example 7: 
 
                     3x + 2     2x + 5 
                     _____  = ______ 
                     2x + 5     3x + 2 
    In the conventional text book method, we work as follows : 
 
                       3x + 2            2x + 5 
                       _____      =    ______ 
                       2x + 5            3x + 2 
 
                   ( 3x + 2 ) ( 3x + 2 ) = ( 2x + 5 ) ( 2x + 5 ) 
                           9x2 + 12x + 4 = 4x2 + 20x + 25 
                    9x2 + 12x + 4 - 4x2 - 20x – 25 = 0 
                                           5x2 – 8x – 21 = 0 
                                   5x2 – 15x + 7x – 21 = 0 
                             5x ( x – 3 ) + 7 ( x – 3 ) = 0 
                                     (x – 3 ) ( 5x + 7 ) = 0 
                                    x – 3 = 0 or 5x + 7 = 0 
                                         x = 3 or - 7 / 5 
    Now ‘Samuccaya’ sutra comes to help us in a beautiful way as follows :  
 
                   Observe N1 + N2 = 3x + 2 + 2x + 5 = 5x + 7 
                               D1 + D2 = 2x + 5 + 3x + 2 = 5x + 7 
 
        Further  N1 ~ D1 = ( 3x + 2 ) – ( 2x + 5 ) = x – 3 
                   N2 ~ D2 = ( 2x + 5) – ( 3x + 2 ) = - x + 3 = - ( x – 3 )

58 
 
        Hence  5x + 7 = 0 , x – 3 = 0 
                     5x = -7 , x = 3 
                           i.e., x = -7 / 5 , x = 3 
 
        Note that all these can be easily calculated by mere observation.  
Example 8:  
 
                           3x + 4       5x + 6 
                           ______  =  _____ 
                           6x + 7       2x + 3 
 
        Observe that  
                   N1 + N2 = 3x + 4 + 5x + 6 = 8x + 10 
              andD1 + D2 = 6x + 7 + 2x + 3 = 8x + 10 
 
        Further     N1 ~D1 = (3x + 4) – (6x + 7)  
                                  =  3x + 4 – 6x – 7  
                                  = -3x – 3  = -3 ( x + 1 ) 
                     N2 ~ D2  = (5x + 6) – (2x + 3) = 3x + 3 = 3( x + 1)  
    By ‘Sunyam Samuccaye’ we have 
 
                   8x + 10 = 0            3( x + 1 ) = 0 
                          8x = -10              x + 1 = 0 
                            x = - 10 / 8             x = -1 
                              = - 5 / 4 
vi)‘Samuccaya’ with the same sense but with a different context and 
application . 
 
       Example 9: 
 
                        1          1            1           1 
                     ____  +  _____  =  ____  +  ____ 
                     x - 4      x – 6      x - 2      x - 8 
        Usually we proceed as follows. 
 
                x–6+x-4                x–8+x-2  
              ___________   =    ___________ 
               (x–4) (x–6)            (x–2) (x-8)

59 
 
                    2x-10                2x-10 
               _________     =     _________ 
               x2–10x+24           x2–10x+16 
 
              ( 2x – 10 ) ( x2 – 10x + 16 ) = ( 2x – 10 ) ( x2 – 10x + 24) 
           2x3–20x2+32x–10x2+100x–160 = 2x3–20x2+48x–10x2+100x-240 
               2x3 – 30x2 + 132x – 160 = 2x3 – 30x2 + 148x – 240 
                                132x – 160 = 148x – 240 
                              132x – 148x = 160 – 240 
                                       – 16x = - 80 
                                  x = - 80 / - 16 = 5 
Now ‘Samuccaya’ sutra, tell us that, if other elements being equal, the sum-
total of the denominators on the L.H.S. and their total on the R.H.S. be the 
same, that total is zero.  
    Now D1 + D2 = x – 4 + x – 6 = 2x – 10, and  
               D3 + D4 = x – 2 + x – 8 = 2x – 10 
By Samuccaya, 2x – 10 gives 2x = 10 
 
                          10 
                   x  =  __  =  5 
                           2 
Example 10: 
 
               1        1           1           1 
            ____  + ____  =   ____  +  _____ 
             x -8     x – 9      x -5      x – 12 
 
            D1 +D2 = x – 8 + x – 9 = 2x – 17, and  
            D3 +D4 = x – 5 + x –12 = 2x – 17 
                   Now 2x – 17 = 0 gives 2x = 17  
 
                                   17 
                           x  =  __  =  8½ 
                                    2 
Example 11: 
 
               1           1           1            1 
            ____  -  _____  =   ____  -  _____

     This is not in the expected form. But a little work regarding transposition 
makes the above as follows. 
 
               1          1           1           1 
            ____  +  ____  =  ____  +  _____ 
             x +7     x + 9      x +6      x + 10 
 
     Now ‘Samuccaya’ sutra applies  
 
            D1 +D2 = x + 7 + x + 9 = 2x + 16, and  
            D3 +D4 = x + 6 + x + 10 = 2x + 16 
   Solution is given by 2x + 16 = 0 i.e., 2 x = - 16. 
                                                            x = - 16 / 2 = - 8.

Sunyam Samya Samuccaye in Certain Cubes: 
Consider the problem ( x – 4 )3 + ( x – 6 )3 = 2 ( x – 5)3. For the solution 
by the traditional method we follow the steps as given below: 
 
                ( x – 4 )3 + ( x – 6 )3 = 2 ( x – 5 )3 
         x3 – 12x2 + 48x – 64 + x3 – 18x2 + 108x – 216 
                                               = 2 ( x3 – 15x2 + 75x – 125 ) 
            2x3 – 30x2 + 156x – 280 = 2x3 – 30x2 + 150x – 250 
                               156x – 280 = 150x – 250 
                              156x – 150x = 280 – 250 
                                           6x = 30 
                                             x = 30 / 6 = 5 
 But once again observe the problem in the vedic sense 
 We have ( x – 4 ) + ( x – 6 ) = 2x – 10. Taking out the numerical factor 2, 
we have ( x – 5 ) = 0, which is the factor under the cube on R.H.S. In such a 
case “Sunyam samya Samuccaye” formula gives that x – 5 = 0. Hence x = 5 
Think of solving the problem (x–249)3 + (x+247)3 = 2(x–1)3 
The traditional method will be horrible even to think of. 
But ( x – 249 ) + ( x + 247 ) = 2x – 2 = 2 ( x – 1 ). And x – 1. on R.H.S.

cube, it is enough to state that x – 1 = 0 by the ‘sutra’. 
x = 1 is the solution. No cubing or any other mathematical operations. 
Algebraic Proof : 
 
        Consider ( x – 2a)3 + ( x – 2b )3 = 2 ( x – a – b )3 it is clear that  
                               x – 2a + x – 2b = 2x – 2a – 2b 
                                                    = 2 ( x – a – b )  
        Now the expression, 
 
         x3 -6x2a + 12xa2 – 8a3 + x3 – 6x2b +12xb2 – 8b3  =  
                2(x3–3x2a–3x2b+3xa2+3xb2+6axb–a3–3a2b–3ab2–b3) 
 
             = 2x3–6x2a–6x2b+6xa2+6xb2+12xab–2a3–6a2b–6ab2–2b3  
  cancel the common terms on both sides  
 
       12xa2+12xb2–8a3–8b3 = 6xa2+6xb2+12xab–2a3–6a2b–6ab2–2b3 
            6xa2 + 6xb2 – 12xab = 6a3 + 6b3 –6a2b – 6ab2 
             6x ( a2 + b2 – 2ab ) = 6 [ a3 + b3 – ab ( a + b )] 
                 x ( a – b )2 = [ ( a + b ) ( a2 + b2 –ab ) – ( a + b )ab] 
                                 = ( a + b ) ( a2 + b2 – 2ab ) 
                                 = ( a + b ) ( a – b )2   
 
                            
  x = a + b 
 
Solve the following using “Sunyam Samuccaye” process : 
 
            1.    ( x – 3 )3 + ( x – 9 )3 = 2 ( x – 6 )3 
 
            2.    ( x + 4 )3 + ( x – 10 )3 = 2 ( x – 3 )3 
 
            3.    ( x + a + b – c )3 + ( x + b + c – a )3 = 2 ( x + b )3

Example : 
 
                       (x + 2)3         x + 1 
                        ______  =   _____ 
                       (x + 3)3         x + 4 
    with the text book procedures we proceed as follows 
 
               x3 + 6x2 + 12x +8         x + 1 
               _______________    =   _____ 
               x3 + 9x2 + 27x +27       x + 4 
    Now by cross multiplication, 
 
    ( x + 4 ) ( x3 +6x2 + 12x + 8 ) = ( x + 1 ) ( x3 + 9x2 + 27x + 27 ) 
       x4 + 6x3 + 12x2+ 8x + 4x3 + 24x2 + 48x + 32 = 
                              x4 + 9x3 + 27x2 + 27x + x3 + 9x2 + 27x + 27 
        x4 +10x3 + 36x2 + 56x + 32 = x4 + 10x3 +36x2 + 54x + 27 
                                 56x + 32 = 54x + 27 
                                56x – 54x = 27 – 32 
                                          2x = - 5 
                                            x = - 5 / 2 
 Observe that ( N1 + D1 ) with in the cubes on 
                            L.H.S. is x + 2 + x + 3 = 2x + 5 and 
 
                        N2 + D2 on the right hand side  
                              is x + 1 + x + 4 = 2x + 5. 
 
      By vedic formula we have 2x + 5 = 0        x = - 5 / 2. 
 
Solve the following by using vedic method : 
 
               1.

6. Anurupye - Sunyamanyat  
The Sutra Anurupye Sunyamanyat says : 'If one is in ratio, the other one is 
zero'. 
We use this Sutra in solving a special type of simultaneous simple equations 
in which the coefficients of 'one' variable are in the same ratio to each other 
as the independent terms are to each other. In such a context the Sutra says 
the 'other' variable is zero from which we get two simple equations in the first 
variable (already considered) and of course give the same value for the 
variable. 
Example 1:  
                           3x +  7y = 2  
                           4x + 21y = 6 
Observe that the y-coefficients are in the ratio 7 : 21 i.e., 1 : 3, which is 
same as the ratio of independent terms i.e., 2 : 6 i.e., 1 : 3. Hence the other 
variable x = 0 and 7y = 2 or 21y = 6 gives y = 2 / 7 
Example 2: 
                           323x + 147y = 1615  
                           969x + 321y = 4845 
The very appearance of the problem is frightening. But just an observation 
and anurupye sunyamanyat give the solution x = 5, because coefficient of x 
ratio is 
        323 : 969 = 1 : 3 and constant terms ratio is 1615 : 4845 = 1 : 3. 
            y = 0 and 323 x = 1615 or 969 x = 4845 gives x = 5. 
 
Solve the following by anurupye sunyamanyat. 
 
        1.   12x + 78y = 12                    2.    3x + 7y = 24

65 
 
              16x + 96y =16                          12x + 5y = 96 
 
        3.    4x – 6y = 24                        4.    ax + by = bm  
              7x – 9y = 36                                cx + dy = dm 
 
In solving simultaneous quadratic equations, also we can take the help of the 
‘sutra’ in the following way: 
Example 3 : 
                  Solve for x and y 
                                                                x + 4y = 10 
                                    x2 + 5xy + 4y2 + 4x - 2y = 20 
 
             x2 + 5xy + 4y2 + 4x - 2y = 20 can be written as  
               ( x + y ) ( x + 4y ) + 4x – 2y = 20 
            10 ( x + y ) + 4x – 2y = 20 ( Since x + 4y = 10 ) 
              10x + 10y + 4x – 2y = 20 
                             14x + 8y = 20 
 
                 Now x + 4y = 10 
            14x + 8y = 20 and 4 : 8 :: 10 : 20 
 
      from the Sutra, x = 0 and 4y = 10, i.e.,, 8y= 20 y = 10/4 = 2½ 
         Thus x = 0 and y = 2½ is the solution. 
 
7. Sankalana - Vyavakalanabhyam  
This Sutra means 'by addition and by subtraction'. It can be applied in solving 
a special type of simultaneous equations where the x - coefficients and the y 
- coefficients are found interchanged. 
Example 1: 
                           45x – 23y = 113 
                           23x – 45y = 91 
In the conventional method we have to make equal either the coefficient of x 
or coefficient of y in both the equations. For that we have to multiply equation 
( 1 ) by 45 and equation ( 2 ) by 23 and subtract to get the value of x and 
then substitute the value of x in one of the equations to get the value of y or 
we have to multiply equation ( 1 ) by 23 and equation ( 2 ) by 45 and then 
subtract to get value of y and then substitute the value of y in one of the

66 
 
equations, to get the value of x. It is difficult process to think of. 
From Sankalana – vyavakalanabhyam 
 
        add them, 
               i.e., ( 45x – 23y ) + ( 23x – 45y ) = 113 + 91 
               i.e., 68x – 68y = 204      
 x – y = 3 
 
      subtract one from other, 
               i.e., ( 45x – 23y ) – ( 23x – 45y ) = 113 – 91 
               i.e., 22x + 22y = 22        
 x + y = 1 
 
      and repeat the same sutra, we get x = 2 and y = - 1 
      Very simple addition and subtraction are enough, however big the 
coefficients may be. 
Example 2: 
                       1955x –   476y = 2482 
                         476x – 1955y = -4913 
Oh ! what a problem ! And still 
 
               just add, 2431( x – y ) = - 2431    
 x – y = -1 
 
               subtract, 1479 ( x + y ) = 7395    
 x + y = 5 
 
               once again add, 2x = 4        
x = 2 
 
               subtract - 2y = - 6       
y = 3  
 
Solve the following problems usingSankalana – Vyavakalanabhyam. 
 
            1.    3x + 2y = 18 
                   2x + 3y = 17 
 
            2.    5x – 21y = 26 
                   21x – 5y = 26 
 
            3.    659x + 956y = 4186 
                   956x + 659y = 3889

67 
 
8. Puranapuranabhyam  
The Sutra can be taken as Purana - Apuranabhyam which means by the 
completion or non - completion. Purana is well known in the present 
system. We can see its application in solving the roots for general form of 
quadratic equation. 
We have : ax2 + bx + c = 0 
 
                  x2 + (b/a)x + c/a  =  0    ( dividing by a ) 
 
                   x2 + (b/a)x = - c/a 
     
    completing the square ( i.e.,, purana ) on the L.H.S. 
 
               x2 + (b/a)x + (b2/4a2) =  -c/a + (b2/4a2) 
 
                 [x + (b/2a)]2 =  (b2 - 4ac) / 4a2 
                                                                          ________ 
                                                                - b ± √ b2 – 4ac 
        Proceeding in this way we finally get x =  _______________ 
                                                                         2a 
    Now we apply purana to solve problems. 
Example 1.   x3 + 6x2 + 11 x + 6 = 0. 
 
                   Since (x + 2 )3 = x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 
                       Add ( x + 2 ) to both sides 
                   We get x3 + 6x2 + 11x + 6 + x + 2 = x + 2 
                       i.e.,, x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 = x + 2 
                       i.e.,, ( x + 2 )3 = ( x + 2 ) 
                   this is of the form y3 = y for y = x + 2 
                   solution y = 0, y = 1, y = - 1 
                               i.e.,, x + 2 = 0,1,-1 
                   which gives x = -2,-1,-3 
Example 2:     x3 + 8x2 + 17x + 10 = 0  
 
            We know ( x + 3)3 = x3 + 9x2 + 27x + 27 
       So adding on the both sides, the term (x2 + 10x + 17 ), we get  
                 x3 + 8x2 + 17x + x2 + 10x + 17 = x2 + 10x + 17  
                 i.e.,, x3 + 9x2 + 27x + 27 = x2 + 6x + 9 + 4x + 8 
                 i.e.,, ( x + 3 )3 = ( x + 3 )2 + 4 ( x + 3 ) – 4

68 
 
                     y3 = y2 + 4y – 4 for y = x + 3  
                       y = 1, 2, -2. 
    Hence x = -2, -1, -5 
         Thus purana is helpful in factorization. 
         Further purana can be applied in solving Biquadratic equations also. 
 
Solve the following using purana – apuranabhyam. 
 
            1.    x3 – 6x2 + 11x – 6 = 0 
            2.    x3 + 9x2 + 23x + 15 = 0  
            3.    x2 + 2x – 3 = 0 
            4.    x4 + 4x3 + 6x2 + 4x – 15 = 0 
 
 
9. Calana - Kalanabhyam  
In the book on Vedic Mathematics Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji mentioned 
the Sutra 'Calana - Kalanabhyam' at only two places. The Sutra means 
'Sequential motion'. 
i) In the first instance it is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation7x2 – 
11x – 7 = 0. Swamiji called the sutra as calculus formula. Its application at 
that point is as follows.Now by calculus formula we say: 14x–11 = ±√317 
A Note follows saying every Quadratic can thus be broken down into two 
binomial factors. An explanation in terms of first differential, discriminant with 
sufficient number of examples are given under the chapter ‘Quadratic 
Equations’. 
ii) At the Second instance under the chapter ‘Factorization and Differential 
Calculus’ for factorizing expressions of 3rd, 4th and 5th degree, the procedure 
is mentioned as'Vedic Sutras relating to Calana – Kalana – Differential 
Calculus'. 
Further other Sutras 10 to 16 mentioned below are also used to get the 
required results. Hence the sutra and its various applications will be taken up 
at a later stage for discussion. 
But sutra – 14 is discussed immediately after this item.

69 
 
Now the remaining sutras : 
 
        10. YĀVADŨNAM ( The deficiency ) 
        11. VYAŞłISAMAŞłIH ( Whole as one and one as whole ) 
        12. ŚEŞĀNYAŃ KENA CARAMEĥA ( Remainder by the last digit ) 
        13. SOPĀNTYADVAYAMANTYAM ( Ultimate and twice the penultimate ) 
        15. GUĥITASAMUCCAYAH ( The whole product is the same ) 
        16. GUĥAKA SAMUCCAYAH ( Collectivity of multipliers ) 
The Sutras have their applications in solving different problems in different 
contexts. Further they are used along with other Sutras. So it is a bit of 
inconvenience to deal each Sutra under a separate heading exclusively and 
also independently. Of course they will be mentioned and also be applied in 
solving the problems in the forth coming chapter wherever necessary. This 
decision has been taken because up to now, we have treated each Sutra 
independently and have not continued with any other Sutra even if it is 
necessary. When the need for combining Sutras for filling the gaps in the 
process arises, we may opt for it. Now we shall deal the fourteenth Sutra, the 
Sutra left so far untouched. 
 
10. Ekanyunena Purvena 
The Sutra Ekanyunena purvena comes as a Sub-sutra to Nikhilam which gives 
the meaning 'One less than the previous' or 'One less than the one before'.  
 
     1) The use of this sutra in case of multiplication by 9,99,999.. is as follows . 
 
    Method :  
a) The left hand side digit (digits) is ( are) obtained by applying the ekanyunena 
purvena i.e. by deduction 1 from the left side digit (digits) . 
         e.g. ( i ) 7 x 9; 7 – 1 = 6 ( L.H.S. digit ) 
b) The right hand side digit is the complement or difference between the 
multiplier and the left hand side digit (digits) . i.e. 7 X 9 R.H.S is 9 - 6 = 3. 
c) The two numbers give the answer; i.e. 7 X 9 = 63. 
Example 1:   8 x 9  Step ( a ) gives 8 – 1 = 7 ( L.H.S. Digit ) 
                                 Step ( b ) gives 9 – 7 = 2 ( R.H.S. Digit ) 
                                 Step ( c ) gives the answer 72

70 
 
Example 2:  15 x 99   Step ( a ) : 15 – 1 = 14 
                                     Step ( b ) : 99 – 14 = 85 ( or 100 – 15 ) 
                                     Step ( c ) : 15 x 99 = 1485 
Example 3:   24 x 99 
        Answer :  
                   
                         
Example 4:     356 x 999 
        Answer : 
                
 
Example 5:     878 x 9999 
        Answer : 
                   
      
Note the process : The multiplicand has to be reduced by 1 to obtain the LHS 
and the rightside is mechanically obtained by the subtraction of the L.H.S from 
the multiplier which is practically a direct application of Nikhilam Sutra. 
 
    Now by Nikhilam 
 
                          24 – 1  = 23    L.H.S. 
                       x 99 – 23 = 76    R.H.S.  (100–24) 
                       _____________________________ 
                                  23 / 76                            = 2376     
Reconsider the Example 4: 
 
                         356 – 1    = 355    L.H.S. 
                      x 999 – 355 = 644    R.H.S. 
                     ________________________ 
                                355 / 644                   =   355644

71 
 
and in Example 5: 878 x 9999 we write 
 
                   0878 –  1   = 877     L.H.S. 
                x 9999 – 877 = 9122    R.H.S. 
               __________________________ 
                             877 / 9122               =  8779122 
Algebraic proof :  
As any two digit number is of the form ( 10x + y ), we proceed  
                  ( 10x + y ) x 99 
                = ( 10x + y ) x ( 100 – 1 ) 
                = 10x . 102 – 10x + 102 .y – y 
                = x . 103 + y . 102 – ( 10x + y ) 
                = x . 103 + ( y – 1 ) . 102 + [ 102 – ( 10x + y )] 
    Thus the answer is a four digit number whose 1000th place is x,100th place is 
( y - 1 ) and the two digit number which makes up the 10th and unit place is the 
number obtained by subtracting the multiplicand from 100.(or apply nikhilam). 
 
        Thus in 37 X 99. The 1000th place is x i.e. 3 
 
        100th place is ( y - 1 ) i.e. (7 - 1 ) = 6 
 
        Number in the last two places 100-37=63. 
 
        Hence answer is 3663. 
 
    Apply Ekanyunena purvena to find out the products 
 
        1. 64 x 99          2.  723 x 999           3. 3251 x 9999 
 
        4. 43 x 999        5.  256 x 9999         6.  1857 x 99999  
 
We have dealt the cases  
   i) When the multiplicand and multiplier both have the same number of digits  
        ii) When the multiplier has more number of digits than the multiplicand. 
In both the cases the same rule applies. But what happens when the multiplier 
has lesser digits? 
i.e. for problems like 42 X 9, 124 X 9, 26325 X 99 etc.,

72 
 
For this let us have a re-look in to the process for proper understanding. 
Multiplication table of 9. 
                                            a    b 
                            2 x 9  =    1    8 
                            3 x 9  =    2    7 
                            4 x 9  =    3    6 
                            - - - - - - - - - -  
                            8 x 9  =    7    2 
                            9 x 9  =    8    1 
                          10 x 9  =    9    0 
Observe the left hand side of the answer is always one less than the 
multiplicand (here multiplier is 9) as read from Column (a) and the right hand 
side of the answer is the complement of the left hand side digit from 9 as read 
from Column (b) 
Multiplication table when both multiplicand and multiplier are of 2 
digits. 
                         a     b 
              11 x 99 = 10    89 = (11–1) / 99 – (11–1) = 1089 
              12 x 99 = 11    88 = (12–1) / 99 – (12–1) = 1188 
              13 x 99 = 12    87 = (13–1) / 99 – (13–1) = 1287 
             ------------------------------------------------- 
              18 x 99 = 17    82  ---------------------------- 
              19 x 99 = 18    81 
              20 x 99 = 19    80 = (20–1) / 99 – (20–1) = 1980 
The rule mentioned in the case of above table also holds good here 
Further we can state that the rule applies to all cases, where the multiplicand 
and the multiplier have the same number of digits. 
Consider the following Tables. 
(i) 
                                      a    b 
                       11 x 9 =   9    9 
                       12 x 9 = 10    8 
                       13 x 9 = 11    7 
                  ---------------------- 
                       18 x 9 = 16    2 
                       19 x 9 = 17    1 
                       20 x 9 = 18    0

73 
 
(ii) 
                       21 x 9 = 18    9 
                       22 x 9 = 19    8 
                       23 x 9 = 20    7 
                  -----------------------  
                       28 x 9 = 25    2 
                       29 x 9 = 26    1 
                       30 x 9 = 27    0 
(iii) 
                       35 x 9 = 31    5 
                       46 x 9 = 41    4 
                       53 x 9 = 47    7 
                       67 x 9 = 60    3 
                 -------------------------so on. 
From the above tables the following points can be observed: 
1) Table (i) has the multiplicands with 1 as first digit except the last one. Here 
L.H.S of products are uniformly 2 less than the multiplicands. So also with20 x 9  
2) Table (ii) has the same pattern. Here L.H.S of products are uniformly 3 less 
than the multiplicands. 
3) Table (iii) is of mixed example and yet the same result i.e. if 3 is first digit 
of the multiplicand then L.H.S of product is 4 less than the multiplicand; if 4 is 
first digit of the multiplicand then, L.H.S of the product is 5 less than the 
multiplicand and so on. 
4) The right hand side of the product in all the tables and cases is obtained by 
subtracting the R.H.S. part of the multiplicand by Nikhilam. 
Keeping these points in view we solve the problems: 
Example1 : 42 X 9 
i) Divide the multiplicand (42) of by a Vertical line or by theSign : into a right 
hand portion consisting of as many digits as the multiplier. 
 
                       i.e. 42 has to be written as 4/2 or 4:2 
ii) Subtract from the multiplicand one more than the whole excess portion on 
the left. i.e. left portion of multiplicand is 4. 
 
                       one more than it 4 + 1 = 5.

74 
 
               We have to subtract this from multiplicand  
                       i.e. write it as  
                                       4  :  2  
                                           :-5  
                                 ---------------  
                                       3  :  7  
 
            This gives the L.H.S part of the product. 
This step can be interpreted as "take the ekanyunena and sub tract from the 
previous" i.e. the excess portion on the left. 
iii) Subtract the R.H.S. part of the multiplicand by nikhilam process. 
i.e. R.H.S of multiplicand is 2 
 
                   its nikhilam is 8 
 
               It gives the R.H.S of the product 
 
               i.e. answer is 3 : 7 : 8 = 378. 
 
               Thus 42 X 9 can be represented as 
 
                           4 : 2 
                              :-5 : 8  
                    ------------------  
                           3 : 7 : 8 = 378. 
Example 2 :     124 X 9 
 
              Here Multiplier has one digit only . 
 
                       We write 12 : 4  
 
              Now step (ii),12 + 1 = 13 
 
                         i.e.    12 : 4  
                                 -1 : 3   
                             ------------  
              Step ( iii ) R.H.S. of multiplicand is 4. Its Nikhilam is 6 
 
                124 x 9 is    12 : 4  
                                   -1 : 3 : 6  
                           -----------------  
                                  11 : 1 : 6    =    1116

75 
 
        The process can also be represented as  
        124 x 9 = [ 124 – ( 12 + 1 ) ] : ( 10 – 4 ) = ( 124 – 13 ) : 6 = 1116 
Example 3:     15639 x 99 
 
     Since the multiplier has 2 digits, the answer is  
     [15639 – (156 + 1)] : (100 – 39) = (15639 – 157) : 61 = 1548261 
 
Find the products in the following cases. 
 
        1.   58 x 9        2.   62 x 9                3.   427 x 99 
 
        4.   832 x 9      5.   24821 x 999     6. 111011 x 99 
 
Ekanyunena Sutra is also useful in Recurring Decimals. We can take up this 
under a separate treatment. 
Thus we have a glimpse of majority of the Sutras. At some places some Sutras 
are mentioned as Sub-Sutras. Any how we now proceed into the use of Sub-
Sutras. As already mentioned the book on Vedic Mathematics enlisted 13 Upa-
Sutras. 
But some approaches in the Vedic Mathematics book prompted some serious 
research workers in this field to mention some other Upa-Sutras. We can 
observe those approaches and developments also. 
 
11. Anurupyena 
The upa-Sutra 'anurupyena' means 'proportionality'. This Sutra is highly useful 
to find products of two numbers when both of them are near the Common bases 
i.e powers of base 10 . It is very clear that in such cases the expected 
'Simplicity ' in doing problems is absent. 
Example 1: 46 X 43 
As per the previous methods, if we select 100 as base we get 
 
                   46   -54    This is much more difficult and of no use. 
                   43   -57 
                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

76 
 
Now by ‘anurupyena’ we consider a working base In three ways. We can solve 
the problem. 
Method 1: Take the nearest higher multiple of 10. In this case it is 50. 
 
        Treat it as 100 / 2 = 50. Now the steps are as follows: 
i) Choose the working base near to the numbers under consideration. 
i.e., working base is 100 / 2 = 50 
 
ii) Write the numbers one below the other 
 
               i.e.     4    6  
                        4    3  
                      ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
 
iii) Write the differences of the two numbers respectively from 50 against each 
number on right side 
 
               i.e.    46    -04  
                       43    -07 
                      ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
 
iv) Write cross-subtraction or cross- addition as the case may be under the line 
drawn. 
 
                      
 
 
v) Multiply the differences and write the product in the left side of the answer. 
 
                          46    -04 
                          43    -07 
                      ____________ 
                       39  / -4 x –7 
 
                            = 28 
 
vi) Since base is 100 / 2 = 50 , 39 in the answer represents 39X50. 
 
    Hence divide 39 by 2 because 50 = 100 / 2

77 
 
Thus 39 ÷ 2 gives 19½ where 19 is quotient and 1 is remainder . This 1 as 
Reminder gives one 50 making the L.H.S of the answer 28 + 50 = 78(or 
Remainder ½ x 100 + 28 ) 
i.e. R.H.S 19 and L.H.S 78 together give the answer1978 We represent it as 
 
                   46    -04 
                   43    -07 
                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
              2)  39  /   28 
                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾                    
                  19½ /  28 
 
               = 19 / 78 = 1978  
Example 2:  42 X 48. 
With 100 / 2 = 50 as working base, the problem is as follows: 
 
                   42    -08 
                   48    -02 
                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
               2) 40   /  16 
                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾  
                   20  /   16 
 
                42 x 48 = 2016 
Method 2: For the example 1: 46X43. We take the same working base 50. We 
treat it as 50=5X10. i.e. we operate with 10 but not with 100 as in method 
 
            now 
                       
 
                                (195 + 2) / 8  =  1978 
 
    [Since we operate with 10, the R.H.S portion shall have only unit place 
.Hence out of the product 28, 2 is carried over to left side. The L.H.S portion of 
the answer shall be multiplied by 5, since we have taken 50 = 5 X 10.]

78 
 
Now in the example 2: 42 x 48 we can carry as follows by treating 50 = 5 x 10 
 
                       
 
Method 3: We take the nearest lower multiple of 10 since the numbers are 46 
and 43 as in the first example, We consider 40 as working base and treat it as 4 
X 10. 
 
                   
 
 
     Since 10 is in operation 1 is carried out digit in 18. 
Since 4 X 10 is working base we consider 49 X 4 on L.H.S of answer i.e. 196 
and 1 carried over the left side, giving L.H.S. of answer as 1978. Hence the 
answer is 1978.  
We proceed in the same method for 42 X 48 
 
                   
 
Let us see the all the three methods for a problem at a glance 
 
     Example 3: 24 X 23

79 
 
 
     Method - 1:     Working base = 100 / 5 = 20 
 
                   24    04 
                   23    03 
                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
              5)  27 /  12 
                 ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                 5 2/5 / 12    =  5 / 52  = 552 
 
        [Since 2 / 5 of 100 is 2 / 5 x 100 = 40 and 40 + 12 = 52] 
Method - 2:  Working base 2 X 10 = 20 
 
                           
 
Now as 20 itself is nearest lower multiple of 10 for the problem under 
consideration, the case of method – 3 shall not arise. 
Let us take another example and try all the three methods. 
Example 4: 492 X 404 
Method - 1 :  working base = 1000 / 2 = 500 
 
                       492    -008 
                       404    -096 
                      ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                  2)  396  /  768      since 1000 is in operation 
                      ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
                      198  /   768       =  198768

80 
 
Method 2: working base = 5 x 100 = 500 
 
                       
 
Method - 3. 
          Since 400 can also be taken as working base, treat 400 = 4 X 100 as 
working base. 
 
            Thus 
                           
 
        No need to repeat that practice in these methods finally takes us to work 
out all these mentally and getting the answers straight away in a single line. 
Example 5:   3998 X 4998 
 
               Working base = 10000 / 2 = 5000 
 
                   3998    -1002 
                   4998    -0002 
                  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
               2) 3996  /  2004       since 10,000 is in operation 
 
                  1998  /  2004        =  19982004 
or taking working base = 5 x 1000 = 5,000 and

81 
 
    What happens if we take 4000 i.e. 4 X 1000 as working base? 
                     _____ 
           3998    0002 
           4998    0998        Since 1000 is an operation 
          ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
            4996 / 1996 
                                           ___                                  ___ 
     As 1000 is in operation, 1996 has to be written as 1996 and 4000 as base, 
the L.H.S portion 5000 has to be multiplied by 4. i. e. the answer is 
 
                      
  
A simpler example for better understanding. 
Example 6: 58 x 48 
 
          Working base 50 = 5 x 10 gives 
 
                       
 
 
          Since 10 is in operation. 
Use anurupyena by selecting appropriate working base and method. 
 
      Find the following product. 
 
        1.   46 x 46           2. 57 x 57                   3.  54 x 45 
 
        4.   18 x 18           5. 62 x 48                   6. 229 x 230

12. Adyamadyenantya – mantyena 
The Sutra ' adyamadyenantya-mantyena' means 'the first by the first and the 
last by the last'. 
Suppose we are asked to find out the area of a rectangular card board whose 
length and breadth are respectively 6ft . 4 inches and 5 ft. 8 inches. Generally 
we continue the problem like this. 
        Area = Length X Breath 
 
                   = 6’ 4" X 5’ 8" Since 1’ = 12", conversion  
 
                   = ( 6 X 12 + 4) ( 5 X 12 + 8) in to single unit 
 
                   = 76" 68" = 5168 Sq. inches. 
Since 1 sq. ft. =12 X 12 = 144sq.inches we have area 
 
           5168    =    144) 5168 (35 
           ‾‾‾‾ 
            144                  432 
                                   ‾‾‾‾ 
                                    848 
                                    720    i.e., 35 Sq. ft 128 Sq. inches 
                                   ‾‾‾‾‾ 
                                    128 
By Vedic principles we proceed in the way "the first by first and the last by last"  
 
        i.e. 6’ 4" can be treated as 6x + 4 and 5’ 8" as 5x + 8,  
 
            Where x= 1ft. = 12 in;x2 is sq. ft. 
Now ( 6x + 4 )(5x + 8 ) 
 
            = 30x2 + 6.8.x + 4.5.x + 32 
            = 30x2 + 48x + 20x + 32 
            = 30x2 + 68. x + 32 
            = 30x2 + ( 5x + 8 ). x + 32 Writing 68 = 5 x 12 + 8 
            = 35x2 + 8. x + 32 
            = 35 Sq. ft. + 8 x 12 Sq. in + 32 Sq. in 
            = 35 Sq. ft. + 96 Sq. in + 32 Sq. in 
            = 35 Sq. ft. + 128 Sq. in

83 
 
It is interesting to know that a mathematically untrained and even uneducated 
carpenter simply works in this way by mental argumentation. It goes in his 
mind like this 
 
                       6’    4" 
 
                       5’    8" 
 
        First by first i.e. 6’ X 5’ = 30 sq. ft. 
 
        Last by last i.e. 4" X 8" = 32 sq. in. 
 
        Now cross wise 6 X 8 + 5 x 4 = 48 +20 = 68. 
Adjust as many '12' s as possible towards left as 'units' i.e. 68 = 5 X 12 +8 , 5 
twelve's as 5 square feet make the first 30+5 = 35 sq. ft ; 8 left becomes 8 x 
12 square inches and go towards right i.e. 8 x 12 = 96 sq. in. towards right ives 
96+32 = 128sq.in. 
Thus he got area in some sort of 35 squints and another sort of 128 sq. units. 
i.e. 35 sq. ft 128 sq. in 
Another Example: 
 
                   
 
 
        Now 12 + 2 = 14, 10 x 12 + 24 = 120 + 24 = 144 
 
        Thus 4′ 6″ x 3′ 4″ = 14 Sq. ft. 144 Sq. inches. 
 
        Since 144 sq. in = 12 X 12 = 1 sq. ft The answer is 15 sq. ft. 
 
        We can extend the same principle to find volumes of parallelepiped also.

        1).   l = 3’ 8" , b = 2’ 4 "            2).   l = 12’ 5" ,  b = 5’ 7"

        4).   l = 6 yard 6 ft. b = 5 yards 2 ft. 
 
 
    II. Find the area of the trapezium in each of the following cases. 
Recall area =½ h (a + b) where a, b are parallel sides and h is the 
distance between them. 
 
        1).   a = 3’ 7", b = 2’ 4", h = 1’ 5" 
 
        2).   a = 5’ 6", b = 4’ 4", h = 3’ 2" 
 
        3).   a = 8’ 4", b = 4’ 6", h = 5’ 1". 
 
Factorization of quadratics: 
 
        The usual procedure of factorizing a quadratic is as follows: 
 
                      3x2 + 8x + 4 
                   = 3x2 + 6x + 2x + 4 
                   = 3x ( x + 2 ) + 2 ( x + 2 ) 
                   = ( x + 2 ) ( 3x + 2 ) 
But by mental process, we can get the result immediately. The steps are as 
follows. 
i). Split the middle coefficient in to two such parts that the ratio of the first 
coefficient to the first part is the same as the ratio of the second part to the last 
coefficient. Thus we split the coefficient of middle term of 3x2 + 8x + 4 i.e. 8 in 
to two such parts 6 and 2 such that the ratio of the first coefficient to the first 
part of the middle coefficient i.e. 3:6 and the ratio of the second pat to the last 
coefficient, i.e. 2: 4 are the same. It is clear that 3:6 = 2:4. Hence such split is 
valid. Now the ratio 3: 6 = 2: 4 = 1:2 gives one factor x+2. 
 
ii). Second factor is obtained by dividing the first coefficient of the quadratic by 
the fist coefficient of the factor already found and the last coefficient of the 
quadratic by the last coefficient of the factor.

85 
 
        i.e. the second factor is 
 
                     3x2          4 
                    ____  +  ___  =  3x + 2 
                      x          2 
        Hence 3x2 + 8x + 4 = ( x + 2 ) ( 3x + 2 ) 
Eg.1: 4x2 + 12x + 5 
i) Split 12 into 2 and 10 so that as per rule 4 : 2 = 10 : 5 = 2 : 1i.e.,, 2x + 1 is 
first factor. 
 
ii) Now 
            4x2      5 
            ___  + __  =  2x + 5   is second factor. 
           2x         1 
Eg.2: 15x2 – 14xy – 8y2 
i) Split –14 into –20, 6 so that 15 : - 20 = 3 : - 4 and 6 : - 8 = 3 : - 4. Both are 
same.i.e., ( 3x – 4y ) is one factor. 
 
ii) Now 
           15x2        8y2 
           ____   +  ___   =  5x + 2y is second factor. 
             3x         -4y 
Thus 15x2 – 14xy – 8y2 = ( 3x – 4y ) ( 5x + 2y ). 
It is evident that we have applied two sub-sutras ‘anurupyena’ 
i.e.‘proportionality’ and ‘adyamadyenantyamantyena’ i.e. ‘the first by the 
first and the last by the last’ to obtain the above results. 
Factorise the following quadratics applying appropriate vedic maths

            2).  6x2 – 23x + 7

13. Yavadunam Tavadunikrtya Varganca Yojayet 
The meaning of the Sutra is 'what ever the deficiency subtract that deficit from 
the number and write along side the square of that deficit'. 
This Sutra can be applicable to obtain squares of numbers close to bases of 
powers of 10. 
Method-1 : Numbers near and less than the bases of powers of 10. 
 
    Eg 1:  92 Here base is 10. 
 
        The answer is separated in to two parts by a’/’  
 
        Note that deficit is 10 - 9 = 1 
 
        Multiply the deficit by itself or square it 
 
        12 = 1. As the deficiency is 1, subtract it from the number i.e., 9–1 = 8. 
 
        Now put 8 on the left and 1 on the right side of the vertical line or slash 
i.e., 8/1. 
 
        Hence 81 is answer. 
Eg. 2:  962 Here base is 100. 
 
        Since deficit is 100-96=4 and square of it is 16 and the deficiency 
subtracted from the number 96 gives 96-4 = 92, we get the answer 92 / 16  
Thus 962 = 9216. 
Eg. 3:  9942 Base is 1000 
 
        Deficit is 1000 - 994 = 6. Square of it is 36. 
 
        Deficiency subtracted from 994 gives 994 - 6 = 988 
 
        Answer is 988 / 036    [since base is 1000] 
Eg. 4:   99882   Base is 10,000. 
 
        Deficit = 10000 - 9988 = 12. 
 
        Square of deficit = 122 = 144. 
 
        Deficiency subtracted from number = 9988 - 12 = 9976.

87 
 
 
        Answer is 9976 / 0144    [since base is 10,000]. 
Eg. 5:   882   Base is 100. 
 
        Deficit = 100 - 88 = 12. 
 
        Square of deficit = 122 = 144.  
 
        Deficiency subtracted from number =88 - 12 = 76. 
 
        Now answer is 76 / 144 =7744    [since base is 100] 
Algebraic proof:  
The numbers near and less than the bases of power of 10 can be treated as (x-
y), where x is the base and y, the deficit. 
 
        Thus  
           (1) 9 = (10 -1) (2) 96 = ( 100-4) (3) 994 = (1000-6) 
 
            (4) 9988 = (10000-12 ) (v) 88 = (100-12) 
 
            ( x – y )2 =x2 – 2xy + y2 
                        = x ( x – 2y ) + y2 
                        = x ( x – y – y ) + y2 
                        = Base ( number – deficiency ) + ( deficit )2 
        Thus 
 
            9852 = ( 1000 – 15)2 
                  = 1000 ( 985 – 15 ) + (15)2 
                  = 1000 ( 970 ) + 225 
                  = 970000 + 225 
                  = 970225. 
or we can take the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b) ( a - b) and proceed as 
 
                 a2 - b2 = (a + b) ( a - b). 
 
        gives         a2 = (a + b) ( a - b) +b2 
 
    Thus for a = 985 and b = 15; 
 
        a2= (a + b) ( a - b) + b2 
 
    9852 = ( 985 + 15 ) ( 985 - 15 ) + (15)2

88 
 
 
           = 1000 ( 970 ) + 225 
 
           = 970225. 
Method. 2 : Numbers near and greater than the bases of powers of 10. 
 
     Eg.(1):  132 . 
 
        Instead of subtracting the deficiency from the number we add and proceed 
as in Method-1. 
 
        for 132 , base is 10, surplus is 3. 
 
        Surplus added to the number = 13 + 3 = 16. 
 
        Square of surplus = 32 = 9 
 
        Answer is 16 / 9 = 169. 
 
     Eg.(2):   1122 
 
           Base = 100, Surplus = 12,  
 
        Square of surplus = 122 = 144 
 
        add surplus to number = 112 + 12 = 124. 
 
        Answer is 124 / 144 = 12544 
 
    Or think of identity a2 = (a + b) (a – b) + b2  for a = 112, b = 12: 
 
               1122 = (112 + 12) (112 – 12) + 122 
                       = 124 (100) + 144 
                       = 12400 + 144 
                       = 12544. 
 
            (x + y)2 =x2 + 2xy + y2 
                        = x ( x + 2y ) + y2 
                        = x ( x + y + y ) + y2 
 
        = Base ( Number + surplus ) + ( surplus)2 
 
       gives 
            1122 =100 ( 112 + 12 ) +122 
                   = 100 ( 124 ) + 144

89 
 
                   = 12400 + 144 
                   = 12544. 
 
     Eg. 3:   100252 
 
               = ( 10025 + 25 ) / 252 
 
               = 10050 / 0625     [ since base is 10,000 ] 
 
               = 100500625. 
Method - 3: This is applicable to numbers which are near to multiples of 10, 
100, 1000 .... etc. For this we combine the upa-Sutra 'anurupyena' and 
'yavadunam tavadunikritya varganca yojayet' together. 
Example 1:   3882  Nearest base = 400.  
 
        We treat 400 as 4 x 100. As the number is less than the base we proceed 
as follows 
 
        Number 388, deficit = 400 - 388 = 12 
 
        Since it is less than base, deduct the deficit  
 
            i.e. 388 - 12 = 376.  
 
        multiply this result by 4 since base is 4 X 100 = 400. 
 
                   376 x 4 = 1504 
 
        Square of deficit = 122 = 144. 
 
        Hence answer is 1504 / 144 = 150544   [since we have taken multiples of 
100]. 
Example 2:  4852 Nearest base = 500. 
 
        Treat 500 as 5 x 100 and proceed

90 
 
Example 3:   672 Nearest base = 70 
 
               
 
    Example 4:   4162 Nearest ( lower ) base = 400 
 
            Here surplus = 16 and 400 = 4 x 100 
 
                 
                  
Example 5:   50122 Nearest lower base is 5000 = 5 x 1000 
 
        Surplus = 12 
 
            
 
 
Apply yavadunam to find the following squares. 
 
            1.  72             2.  982           3.  9872          4.  142          
 
            5.  1162        6.  10122        7.  192            8.  4752  
 
            9.  7962      10.  1082        11. 99882      12.  60142.
 
So far we have observed the application of yavadunam in finding the squares of 
number. Now with a slight modification yavadunam can also be applied for 
finding the cubes of numbers.

91 
 
     Cubing of Numbers: 
 
     Example :  Find the cube of the number 106. 
 
      We proceed as follows: 
i)   For 106, Base is 100. The surplus is 6. 
 
    Here we add double of the surplus i.e. 106+12 = 118. 
 
    (Recall in squaring, we directly add the surplus) 
 
    This makes the left-hand -most part of the answer. 
 
            i.e. answer proceeds like 118 / - - - - -  
 
ii)  Put down the new surplus i.e. 118-100=18 multiplied by the initial surplus 
 
            i.e. 6=108. 
 
  Since base is 100, we write 108 in carried over form 108 i.e. . 
 
  As this is middle portion of the answer, the answer proceeds like 118 / 108 /.... 
 
iii)  Write down the cube of initial surplus i.e. 63 = 216 as the last portion 
 
          i.e. right hand side last portion of the answer. 
 
     Since base is 100, write 216 as 216 as 2 is to be carried over. 
 
     Answer is 118 / 108 / 216 
    Now proceeding from right to left and adjusting the carried over, we get the 
answer 
 
                   119 / 10 / 16 = 1191016. 
Eg.(1):   1023 = (102 + 4) / 6 X 2 / 23 
 
                         =   106      =    12  = 08 
 
                         = 1061208. 
 
        Observe initial surplus = 2, next surplus =6 and base = 100.

92 
 
Eg.(2):   943 
 
        Observe that the nearest base = 100. Here it is deficit contrary to the 
above examples. 
i) Deficit = -6. Twice of it -6 X 2 = -12 
                   add it to the number = 94 -12 =82. 
 
ii) New deficit is -18.  
        Product of new deficit x initial deficit = -18 x -6 = 108 
 
iii) deficit3 = (-6)3 = -216. 
                                                     __ 
       Hence the answer is 82 / 108 / -216  
Since 100 is base 1 and -2 are the carried over. Adjusting the carried over in 
order, we get the answer 
 
            ( 82 + 1 ) /( 08 – 03 ) / ( 100 – 16 ) 
 
               = 83   /    = 05      /    = 84          = 830584 
      __ 
     16 becomes 84 after taking1 from middle most portion i.e. 100. (100-
16=84). 
                                                                                       _ 
        Now 08 - 01 = 07 remains in the middle portion, and2 or 2 carried to it 
makes the middle as 07 - 02 = 05. Thus we get the above result. 
Eg.(3):  
              9983  Base = 1000; initial deficit = - 2. 
 
             9983 = (998 – 2 x 2)  /  (- 6 x – 2)  /  (- 2)3 
 
                     =    994        /     = 012      /  = -008 
 
                     =    994  /  011  /  1000 - 008 
 
                    =     994  /  011  /  992 
 
                    =     994011992. 
Find the cubes of the following numbers using yavadunam sutra. 
 
        1.  105     2.  114         3.  1003        4.  10007         5.  92  
        6.  96       7.  993         8.  9991        9.  1000008     10.  999992.

93 
 
14. Antyayor Dasakepi 
The Sutra signifies numbers of which the last digits added up give 10. i.e. the 
Sutra works in multiplication of numbers for example: 25 and 25, 47 and 43, 62 
and 68, 116 and 114. Note that in each case the sum of the last digit of first 
number to the last digit of second number is 10. Further the portion of digits or 
numbers left wards to the last digits remain the same. At that instant use 
Ekadhikena on left hand side digits. Multiplication of the last digits gives the 
right hand part of the answer. 
Example 1 :  47 X 43 
See the end digits sum 7 + 3 = 10 ; then by the sutras antyayor dasakepi and 
ekadhikena we have the answer.  
 
            47 x 43 = ( 4 + 1 ) x 4/ 7 x 3 
                       = 20 / 21 
                       = 2021. 
Example 2:  62 x 68 
 
          2 + 8 = 10,  L.H.S. portion remains the same i.e.,, 6. 
 
          Ekadhikena of 6 gives 7 
 
             62 x 68 = ( 6 x 7 )/ ( 2 x 8 ) 
                        =  42 / 16 
                        = 4216. 
Example 3:   127 x 123 
 
        As antyayor dasakepi works, we apply ekadhikena 
 
            127 x 123 = 12 x 13/ 7 x 3 
                          = 156 / 21 
                          = 15621. 
Example 4:  65 x 65 
 
        We have already worked on this type. As the present sutra is applicable. 
 
            We have 65 x 65 = 6 x 7/ 5 x 5 
                                    = 4225.

94 
 
Example 5:  3952 
 
            3952 = 395 x 395 
                   = 39 x 40 / 5 x 5 
                   = 1560 / 25 
                   = 156025. 
 
Use Vedic sutras to find the products 
 
        1.  125 x 125           2.  34 x 36           3.  98 x 92 
 
        4.  401 x 409           5.  693 x 697        6. 1404 x 1406 
 
It is further interesting to note that the same rule works when the sum of the 
last 2, last 3, last 4 - - - digits added respectively equal to 100, 1000, 10000 -- 
- - . The simple point to remember is to multiply each product by 10, 100, 
1000, - - as the case may be . Your can observe that this is more convenient 
while working with the product of 3 digit numbers. 
Eg. 1:  292 x 208 
 
        Here 92 + 08 = 100,  L.H.S portion is same i.e. 2 
 
             292 x 208 = ( 2 x 3 )/ 92 x 8 
 
                   
 60  /  =736 ( for 100 raise the L.H.S. product by 0 ) 
 
                         = 60736. 
Eg. 2:   848 X 852 
 
        Here 48 + 52 = 100,  L.H.S portion is 8 and its ‘ekhadhikena’ is 9. 
 
        Now R.H.S product 48 X 52 can be obtained by ‘anurupyena’ mentally.

              2)  50    4     =   24 / ( 100 – 4 )

                   25              = 96

                                = 2496 
 
        and write 848 x 852 = 8 x 9 / 48 x 52 
 
                          
  720 = 2496 
 
                                         = 722496. 
 
     [Since L.H.S product is to be multiplied by 10 and 2 to be carried over as the 
base is 100]. 
Eg. 3:   693 x 607 
 
            693 x 607 = 6 x 7/ 93 x 7 
                          = 420 / 651 
                          = 420651.

15. Antyayoreva 
 
 
'Atyayoreva' means 'only the last terms'. This is useful in solving simple 
equations of the following type. 
The type of equations are those whose numerator and denominator on the 
L.H.S. bearing the independent terms stand in the same ratio to each other as 
the entire numerator and the entire denominator of the R.H.S. stand to each 
other. 
Let us have a look at the following example. 
Example 1: 
 
                       x2 + 2x + 7          x + 2 
                       __________    =   _____ 
                       x2 + 3x + 5          x + 3 
In the conventional method we proceed as 
 
                       x2 + 2x + 7          x + 2 
                       __________    =   _____ 
                       x2 + 3x + 5          x + 3 
 
                   (x + 3) (x2 + 2x + 7) = (x + 2) (x2 + 3x + 5) 
        x3 + 2x2 + 7x +3x2 + 6x + 21 = x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 2x2 +6x + 10 
                    x3 + 5x2 + 13x + 21 = x3 + 5x2 + 11x+ 10 
 
        Canceling like terms on both sides 
 
                13x + 21  = 11x + 10 
                13x – 11x =  10  – 21 
                          2x = -11 
                           x = -11 / 2 
Now we solve the problem using anatyayoreva. 
 
                        x2 + 2x + 7          x + 2 
                       __________    =   _____ 
                       x2 + 3x + 5          x + 3

97 
 
 Consider 
                         x2 + 2x + 7         x + 2 
                       __________    =   _____ 
                       x2 + 3x +5           x + 3 
 
     Observe that 
 
                x2 + 2x      x (x + 2)      x + 2 
                ______  =  ________  =  _____ 
                x2 + 3x      x (x + 3)      x + 3 
 
     This is according to the condition in the sutra. Hence from the sutra 
 
                   x + 2         7 
                   _____   =  __ 
                   x + 3         5 
 
               5x + 10 =  7x + 21 
               7x – 5x = -21 + 10 
                      2x = -11 
                       x = -11 / 2 
Algebraic Proof: 
 
        Consider the equation 
 
               AC + D         A 
               ______   =  ___   ------------- (i) 
               BC + E         B 
    This satisfies the condition in the sutra since 
 
                   AC         A 
                   ___   =  ___ 
                   BC          B 
    Now cross–multiply the equation (i) 
 
               B (AC + D) = A (BC + E) 
                 BAC + BD = ABC + AE 
                          BD = AE which gives 
 
                       A        D 
                      __   =  __    --------(ii) 
                       B        E

98 
 
i.e., the result obtained in solving equation (i) is same as the result obtained in 
solving equation (ii). 
Example 2:  solve 
                               2x2 + 3x + 10        2x + 3 
                               ___________   =    _____ 
                               3x2 + 4x + 14        3x + 4 
Since 
               2x2 + 3x        x (2x +3)        2x+3 
               _______    =  ________    =   ____ 
               3x2 + 4x        x (3x +4)        3x+4 
We can apply the sutra. 
 
               2x + 3         10 
               _____    =    __ 
               3x+4           14 
Cross–multiplying 
 
            28x +  42 = 30x + 40 
            28x – 30x = 40 – 42 
                   -2x = -2         
x = -2 / -2 = 1. 
Let us see the application of the sutra in another type of problem. 
Example 3: (x + 1) (x + 2) (x + 9) = (x + 3) (x + 4) (x + 5) 
 
        Re–arranging the equation, we have 
 
               (x + 1) (x + 2)          x + 3 
               ____________    =    _____ 
               (x + 4) (x + 5)          x + 9 
    i.e., 
               x2 + 3x + 2x + 3 
            = ______________ 
               x2 + 9x + 20x + 9 
Now 
         x2 +3x      x (x + 3)      x + 3 
         ______  =  _______   = _____    gives the solution by antyayoreva 
         x2 +9x      x (x + 9)      x + 9

99 
 
 
Solution is obtained from 
 
                   x + 3          2 
                   ____    =    __ 
                   x + 9         20 
 
               20x + 60 = 2x + 18 
               20x – 2x = 18 – 60 
                      18x = -42        
 x = -42 / 18 = -7 / 3. 
 
    Once again look into the problem 
 
        (x + 1) (x + 2) (x + 9) = (x + 3) (x+ 4) (x + 5) 
 
    Sum of the binomials on each side 
 
            x + 1 + x + 2 + x + 9 = 3x + 12 
            x + 3 + x + 4 + x + 5 = 3x + 12 
It is same. In such a case the equation can be adjusted into the form suitable 
for application of antyayoreva. 
Example 4: (x + 2) (x + 3) (x + 11) = (x + 4) (x + 5) (x + 7) 
 
        Sum of the binomials on L.H.S. = 3x + 16 
        Sum of the binomials on R.H.S. = 3x + 16 
 
        They are same. Hence antyayoreva can be applied. Adjusting we get 
 
        (x + 2) (x + 3)       x + 5         2 x 3          6 
        ____________    = _____   =  _____   =   ___ 
        (x + 4) (x + 7)       x + 11       4 x 7         28 
 
            28x + 140 = 6x + 66 
            28x – 6x = 66 – 140 
                  22x = -74 
 
                   -74        -37 
              x = ___    =  ___ 
                    22         11

16. Lopana Sthapanabhyam 
 
Lopana sthapanabhyam means 'by alternate elimination and retention'. 
Consider the case of factorization of quadratic equation of type ax2 +by2 + cz2 + 
dxy + eyz + fzx This is a homogeneous equation of second degree in three 
variables x, y, z. The sub-sutra removes the difficulty and makes the 
factorization simple. The steps are as follows: 
i) Eliminate z by putting z = 0 and retain x and y and factorize thus obtained a 
quadratic in x and y by means of ‘adyamadyena’ sutra.; 
 
ii) Similarly eliminate y and retain x and z and factorize the quadratic in x and z. 
 
iii) With these two sets of factors, fill in the gaps caused by the elimination 
process of z and y respectively. This gives actual factors of the expression. 
Example 1:  3x2 + 7xy + 2y2 + 11xz + 7yz + 6z2. 
Step (i):   Eliminate z and retain x, y; factorize 
                3x2 + 7xy + 2y2 = (3x + y) (x + 2y) 
 
Step (ii):   Eliminate y and retain x, z; factorize 
                3x2 + 11xz + 6z2 = (3x + 2z) (x + 3z) 
 
Step (iii):   Fill the gaps, the given expression  
                = (3x + y + 2z) (x + 2y + 3z) 
Example 2:   12x2 + 11xy + 2y2 - 13xz - 7yz +3z2. 
Step (i):   Eliminate z i.e., z = 0; factorize 
               12x2 + 11xy + 2y2 = (3x + 2y) (4x + y) 
 
Step (ii):  Eliminate y i.e., y = 0; factorize 
              12x2 - 13xz + 3z2 = (4x -3z) (3x – z) 
 
Step (iii):  Fill in the gaps; the given expression 
                = (4x + y – 3z) (3x + 2y – z) 
Example 3:   3x2+6y2+2z2+11xy+7yz+6xz+19x+22y+13z+20 
Step (i): Eliminate y and z, retain x and independent term 
              i.e., y = 0, z = 0 in the expression (E). 
        Then E = 3x2 + 19x + 20 = (x + 5) (3x + 4)

102 
 
Step (ii): Eliminate z and x, retain y and independent term 
              i.e., z = 0, x = 0 in the expression. 
        Then E = 6y2 + 22y + 20 = (2y + 4) (3y + 5) 
 
Step (iii): Eliminate x and y, retain z and independent term 
               i.e., x = 0, y = 0 in the expression. 
        Then E = 2z2 + 13z + 20 = (z + 4) (2z + 5) 
 
Step (iv):   The expression has the factors (think of independent terms) 
                = (3x + 2y + z + 4) (x + 3y + 2z + 5). 
In this way either homogeneous equations of second degree or general 
equations of second degree in three variables can be very easily solved by 
applying ‘adyamadyena’ and ‘lopanasthapanabhyam’ sutras. 
Solve the following expressions into factors by using appropriate 
sutras: 
 
        1.    x2 + 2y2 + 3xy + 2xz + 3yz +z2. 
 
        2.    3x2 + y2 - 4xy - yz -2z2 - zx. 
 
        3.    2p2 + 2q2 + 5pq + 2p – 5q - 12. 
 
        4.    u2 + v2 – 4u + 6v – 12. 
 
        5.    x2 - 2y2 + 3xy + 4x - y + 2. 
 
        6.    3x2 + 4y2 + 7xy - 2xz - 3yz -z2 + 17x + 21y – z + 20. 
 
Highest common factor: 
To find the Highest Common Factor i.e. H.C.F. of algebraic expressions, the 
factorization method and process of continuous division are in practice in the 
conventional system. We now apply' Lopana - Sthapana' Sutra, the 'Sankalana 
vyavakalanakam' process and the 'Adyamadya' rule to find out the H.C.F in a 
more easy and elegant way. 
Example 1:   Find the H.C.F. of x2 + 5x + 4 and x2 + 7x + 6. 
 
      1.  Factorization method: 
 
               x2 + 5x + 4 = (x + 4) (x + 1) 
               x2 + 7x + 6 = (x + 6) (x + 1)

103 
 
               H.C.F. is ( x + 1 ). 
 
     2. Continuous division process. 
 
         x2 + 5x + 4 ) x2+ 7x + 6 ( 1 
                            x2 + 5x + 4 
                         ___________ 
                                 2x + 2 ) x2 + 5x + 4 ( ½x 
                                             x2 + x 
                                            __________ 
                                                   4x + 4 ) 2x + 2 ( ½ 
                                                               2x + 2 
                                                               ______ 
                                                                   0 
 
            Thus 4x + 4 i.e., ( x + 1 ) is H.C.F. 
 
3. Lopana - Sthapana process i.e. elimination and retention or alternate 
destruction of the highest and the lowest powers is as below: 
                   
 
                  i.e.,, (x + 1) is H.C.F  
Example 2:   Find H.C.F. of 2x2 – x – 3 and 2x2 + x – 6 
 
                
 
Example 3:    x3 – 7x – 6 and x3 +8x2 + 17x + 10. 
 
        Now by Lopana - Sthapana and Sankalana – Vyavakalanabhyam

104 
 
 
                
 
Example 4:   x3 + 6x2 + 5x – 12 and x3 +8x2 + 19x + 12. 
 
               
 
 
                                           (or) 
 
                   
 
Example 5:    2x3 + x2 – 9 andx4 + 2x2 + 9. 
 
        By Vedic sutras: 
 
               Add:  (2x3 + x2 – 9) + (x4 + 2x2 + 9) 
                        = x4 + 2x3 + 3x2. 
 
                  ÷ x2 gives     x2 + 2x + 3 ------ (i) 
 
       Subtract after multiplying the first by x and the second by 2. 
 
            Thus  (2x4 + x3 – 9x) - (2x4 + 4x2 + 18) 
                     = x3 - 4x2 – 9x – 18 ------ ( ii ) 
 
       Multiply (i) by x and subtract from (ii) 
 
               x3 – 4x2 – 9x – 18 – (x3 + 2x2 + 3x) 
                = - 6x2 – 12x – 18 
 
                 ÷ - 6 gives    x2 + 2x + 3.

105 
 
Thus ( x2 + 2x + 3 ) is the H.C.F. of the given expressions. 
Algebraic Proof: 
Let P and Q be two expressions and H is their H.C.F. Let A and B the Quotients 
after their division by H.C.F. 
 
              P                  Q 
        i.e., __  =  A  and __  =  B     which gives P = A.H and Q = B.H 
              H                  H 
 
        P + Q = AH + BH and P – Q = AH –BH 
                = (A+B).H               = (A–B).H 
Thus we can write P ± Q = (A ± B).H 
Similarly MP = M.AH and NQ = N.BH gives MP ± NQ = H (MA ± NB) 
This states that the H.C.F. of P and Q is also the H.C.F. of P±Q or MA±NB. 
i.e. we have to select M and N in such a way that highest powers and lowest 
powers (or independent terms) are removed and H.C.F appears as we have 
seen in the examples. 
Find the H.C.F. in each of the following cases using Vedic sutras: 
 
        1.   x2 + 2x – 8,x2 – 6x + 8 
 
        2.   x3 – 3x2 – 4x + 12,x3 – 7x2 + 16x - 12 
 
        3.   x3 + 6x2 + 11x + 6,x3 – x2 - 10x - 8 
 
        4.   6x4 – 11x3 +16x2 – 22x + 8, 
              6x4 – 11x3 –  8x2 + 22x – 8.

17. Vilokanam 
 
The Sutra 'Vilokanam' means 'Observation'. Generally we come across problems 
which can be solved by mere observation. But we follow the same conventional 
procedure and obtain the solution. But the hint behind the Sutra enables us to 
observe the problem completely and find the pattern and finally solve the 
problem by just observation. 
Let us take the equation x + ( 1/x ) = 5/2 Without noticing the logic in the 
problem, the conventional process tends us to solve the problem in the 
following way. 
 
                       1        5 
               x  + __  =  __ 
                       x        2 
 
                x2 + 1         5 
                _____   =   __ 
                    x            2 
 
                2x2 + 2 = 5x 
                2x2 – 5x + 2 = 0 
                2x2 – 4x – x + 2 = 0 
                2x (x – 2) – (x – 2) = 0 
                   (x – 2) (2x – 1) = 0 
                               x – 2 = 0 gives x = 2 
                             2x – 1 = 0 gives x = ½ 
 
        But by Vilokanam i.e.,, observation 
 
                          1        5 
                   x + __  =  __    can be viewed as 
                          x        2 
 
                          1             1 
                   x + __  =  2 + __     giving x = 2 or ½. 
                          x             2 
Consider some examples. 
Example 1 : 
                        x        x + 2        34 
                  ____  +  _____  =   ___ 
                     x + 2        x           15

107 
 
In the conventional process, we have to take L.C.M, cross-multiplication. 
simplification and factorization. But Vilokanam gives 
 
                   34      9 + 25       3        5 
                   __  =  _____   = __  +  __ 
                   15       5 x 3        5        3 
 
                        x         x + 2        3        5 
                     ____  +  _____  =  __  +__ 
                     x + 2         x           5        3 
 
        gives 
                  x            3                     5 
               _____  =  __         or      __ 
               x + 2         5                     3 
 
            5x = 3x + 6    or     3x = 5x + 10 
            2x = 6           or    -2x = 10 
              x = 3           or        x = -5 
Example 2 :  
 
               x + 5      x + 6         113 
               ____  +  _____   =    ___ 
               x + 6      x + 5          56 
 
        Now, 
               113       49 + 64        7          8 
               ___   =  _______  =___  + ___ 
                56          7 x 8          8          7 
 
               x + 5       7               x+5          8 
               ____   =  __        or   ____  =   __ 
               x + 6       8               x+6          7 
 
            8x + 40 = 7x+ 42        7x + 35 = 8x + 48 
                                      or 
            x = 42 - 40 =2            -x = 48 –35 = 13 
                x = 2               or    x = -13. 
Example 3: 
 
                   5x + 9      5x – 9        82 
                   _____  +  _____  =  2 ___ 
                   5x - 9      5x + 9        319

At first sight it seems to a difficult problem. 
But careful observation gives 
 
                82        720      841 - 121        29       11

(Note: 292 = 841, 112 = 121) 
 
            5x + 9     29        -11 
            _____  = __   or  ___ 
            5x -9      11         29 
(Note: 29 = 20 + 9 = 5 x 4 + 9 ; 11 = 20 – 9 = 5 x 4 – 9 ) 
i.e., 
         x = 4  or 
                     5x + 9        -11 
                     _____   =    ___ 
                     5x - 9          29 
 
            145x + 261 =-55x + 99 
            145x + 55x =  99  – 261 
                   200x = -162 
 
             -162          -81 
        x =  ____   =  ____ 
               200          100 
Simultaneous Quadratic Equations: 
Example 1:    x + y = 9 and xy = 14. 
 
        We follow in the conventional way that 
 
        (x – y)2 = (x + y)2 – 4xy =92 – 4 (14) = 81 - 56 = 25 
            x – y = √ 25 = ± 5 
 
                  
 
 
             x + y = 9 gives 7 + y = 9 
                                      y = 9 – 7 = 2.

109 
 
Thus the solution is x = 7, y = 2 or x = 2, y = 7. 
But by Vilokanam, xy = 14 gives x = 2, y = 7 or x = 7, y = 2 and these two 
sets satisfy x + y = 9 since 2 + 7 = 9 or 7 + 2 = 9. Hence the solution. 
Example 2:     5x – y = 7 and xy = 6. 
 
        xy = 6 gives x = 6, y = 1; x = 1, y = 6; 
 
        x = 2, y = 3; x = 3, y = 2 and of course negatives of all these. 
Observe that x = 6, y = 1; x = 1, y = 6: are not solutions because they do not 
satisfy the equation 5x – y = 7. 
But for x = 2, y = 3; 5x – y = 5 (2) – 3 = 10 – 3 = 7 we have 5(3)–2≠7. 
Hence x = 2, y = 3 is a solution. 
For x = 3, y = 2 we get 5 (3) – 2 = 15 – 2 ≠ 7. 
Hence it is not a solution. 
Negative values of the above are also not the solutions. Thus one set of the 
solutions i.e., x = 2, y = 3 can be found. Of course the other will be obtained 
from solving 5x – y = 7 and 5x + y = -13. 
 
    i.e., x = -3 / 5, y = -10. 
Partial Fractions: 
Example 1:     Resolve 
 
                     2x + 7 
                ___________    into partial fractions. 
               (x + 3) (x + 4) 
 
            
                    2x + 7                  A               B 
       We write   ____________   =   ______   +  ______ 
                       (x + 3)(x + 4)         (x + 3)        (x + 4) 
 
                                                 A (x + 4) + B (x + 3) 
                                            =   __________________ 
                                                      (x + 3) (x + 4)

110 
 
 
                                 2x + 7  ≡    A (x + 4) + B (x+ 3). 
We proceed by comparing coefficients on either side  
 
     coefficient of x : A + B = 2 ..........(i) X 3 
 
     Independent of x : 4A + 3B = 7 .............(ii) 
Solving (ii) – (i) x 3     4A + 3B = 7 
                                   3A + 3B = 6 
                                  ___________ 
                                           A = 1 
 
        A = 1 in (i) gives, 1 + B = 2 i.e., B = 1 
 
    Or we proceed as 
 
                             2x + 7  ≡  A (x + 4) + B (x + 3). 
    Put   x = -3,     2 (-3) + 7 ≡  A (-3 + 4) + B (-3 + 3) 
                                   1 = A (1)     ...A = 1. 
 
           x = -4,    2 (- 4) + 7  =  A (-4 + 4) + B (-4 + 3) 
                                    -1 = B(-1)    ...B = 1. 
 
                               2x + 7                  1             1 
               Thus   ____________    =    _____ +   _____ 
                         (x + 3) (x + 4)         (x +3)      (x + 4) 
 
                                      2x + 7 
        But by Vilokanam ____________    can be resolved as 
                                 (x + 3) (x + 4) 
 
        (x + 3) + (x + 4) =2x +7,     directly we write the answer. 
 
Example 2: 
 
                            3x + 13 
                       ____________ 
                       (x + 1) (x + 2) 
 
        from (x + 1),(x + 2) we can observe that

111 
 
        10 (x + 2) – 7(x + 1) = 10x + 20 – 7x – 7 = 3x + 13 
 
                           3x + 13                 10             7 
           Thus      ____________    =  _____   -  _____ 
                        (x + 1) (x + 2)         x +1        x + 2 
Example 3: 
 
                             9 
                       ________ 
                       x2 + x - 2 
 
        As  x2 + x – 2 = (x – 1) (x + 2) and 
                       9 = 3 (x + 2) – 3 (x – 1) 
                                       (3x + 6 – 3x + 3 = 9) 
 
 
                                                9                      3            3 
        We get by Vilokanam,  ____________  =  ____   - ____ 
                                           x2 + x – 2            x - 1        x + 2

18. Gunita Samuccayah : Samuccaya Gunitah 
In connection with factorization of quadratic expressions a sub-Sutra, viz. 
'Gunita samuccayah-Samuccaya Gunitah' is useful. It is intended for the 
purpose of verifying the correctness of obtained answers in multiplications, 
divisions and factorizations. It means in this context:  
'The product of the sum of the coefficients sc in the factors is equal to the sum 
of the coefficients sc in the product' 
Symbolically we represent as sc of the product = product of the sc (in the 
factors) 
Example 1:     (x + 3) (x + 2) = x2 + 5x + 6 
 
        Now ( x + 3 ) ( x + 2 ) = 4 x 3 = 12 : Thus verified. 
Example 2:     (x – 4) (2x + 5) = 2x2 – 3x – 20 
 
        Sc of the product 2 – 3 – 20 = - 21 
 
        Product of the Sc = (1 – 4) (2 + 5) = (-3) (7) = - 21. Hence verified. 
 
        In case of cubics, biquadratics also the same rule applies. 
 
        We have (x + 2) (x + 3) (x + 4) = x3 +9x2 + 26x + 24 
 
        Sc of the product = 1 + 9 + 26 + 24 = 60 
 
        Product of the Sc = (1 + 2) (1 + 3) (1 + 4) 
 
                               = 3 x 4 x 5 = 60. Verified. 
Example 3:   (x + 5) (x + 7) (x – 2) = x3 + 10x2 + 11x – 70 
 
                       (1 + 5) (1 + 7) (1 – 2) = 1 + 10 + 11 – 70 
 
        i.e.,     6 x 8 x –1 = 22 – 70 
        i.e.,     -48 = -48 Verified. 
We apply and interpret So and Sc as sum of the coefficients of the odd powers 
and sum of the coefficients of the even powers and derive that So = Sc gives (x 
+ 1) is a factor for thee concerned expression in the variable x. Sc = 0 gives (x 
- 1) is a factor.

Verify whether the following factorization of the expressions are 
correct or not by the Vedic check:  
     i.e. Gunita. Samuccayah-Samuccaya Gunitah: 
 
    1.     (2x + 3) (x – 2) = 2x2 – x - 6 
 
    2.     12x2 – 23xy + 10y2 = ( 3x – 2y ) ( 4x – 5y ) 
 
    3.     12x2 + 13x – 4 = ( 3x – 4 ) ( 4x + 1 ) 
 
    4.     ( x + 1 ) ( x + 2 ) ( x + 3 ) = x3 +6x2 + 11x + 6 
 
    5.     ( x + 2 ) ( x + 3 ) ( x + 8 ) = x3 +13x2 + 44x + 48 
So far we have considered a majority of the upa-sutras as mentioned in the 
Vedic mathematics book. Only a few Upa-Sutras are not dealt under a separate 
heading . They are  
 
    2) S’ISYATE S’ESASAMJ ÑAH 
         
    4) KEVALAIH SAPTAKAMGUNYAT 
         
    5) VESTANAM  
         
    6) YAVADŨNAM TAVADŨNAM and 
 
    10) SAMUCCAYAGUNITAH already find place in respective places. 
         
Further in some other books developed on Vedic Mathematics DVANDAYOGA, 
SUDHA, DHVAJANKAM are also given as Sub-Sutras. They are mentioned in the 
Vedic Mathematics text also. But the list in the text (by the Editor) does not 
contain them. We shall also discuss them at appropriate places, with these 
three included, the total number of upa-Sutras comes to sixteen. 
We now proceed to deal the Sutras with reference to their variety, applicability, 
speed, generality etc. Further we think how 'the element of choice in the Vedic 
system, even of innovation, together with mental approach, brings a new 
dimension to the study and practice of Mathematics. The variety and simplicity 
of the methods brings fun and amusement, the mental practice leads to a more 
agile, alert and intelligent mind and innovation naturally follow' (Prof. 
K.R.Williams, London).

III Vedic Mathematics - A briefing 
In the previous chapters we have gone through the Vedic Mathematics Sutras 
and upa - Sutras: their application in solving problems. In this approach we 
have missed to note some points and merits of one method over the other 
methods at some instances. 
Now we take a few steps in this direction. You may question why this book first 
gives examples and methods and then once again try to proceed as if an 
introduction to the Vedic Mathematics has been just started. This is because in 
this approach the reader first feels that it is easy to solve problems using Vedic 
Mathematics. This is clear from the examples given. But the reader may get 
doubt why we are doing this way or that way some times very close and almost 
akin to the conventional textual way; and some times very different from these 
procedures? why new representations and different meanings for the same 
Sutra (!) in different contexts? But observe that it is not uncommon to 
Mathematics. 
Question some body showing the symbol Π. 
Majority may say it is 22 / 7 (is it right?) some may say it is a radian measure. 
Very few may state it is a function or so. 
What does the representation A X B mean? 
A boy thinking about numbers may answer that is A multi plied by B and gives 
the product provided A and B are known. A girl thinking of set notation simply 
says that it is Cartesian product of the sets A and B. No sort of multiplication at 
all. 
Another may conclude that it is a product of two matrices A and B . No doubt a 
multiplication but altogether different from above. 
Some other may go deep in to elementary number theory and may take ' X ' to 
be the symbol ' X ' (does not divide) and conclude 'A does not divide B' 
Now the question arises does a student fail to understand and apply contextual 
meaning and representation of symbols and such forms in mathematical 
writings? certainly not. In the same way the contextual meanings of the Sutras 
also can not bring any problem to the practitioners of Vedic Mathematics. 
Again a careful observation brings all of us to a conclusion that even though the 
Sutras are not like mathematical formulae so as to fit in any context under 
consideration but they are intended to recognize the pattern in the problems 
and suggest procedures to solve. Now recall the terms, rules and methods once 
again to fill in some gaps that occur in the previous attempt.

Terms and Operations 
a) Ekadhika means ‘one more’ 
    e.g:  Ekadhika of 0 is 1 
                Ekadhika of 1 is 2 
                ----------------- 
                Ekadhika of 8 is 9 
                ------------------- 
                Ekadhika of 23 is 24 
                --------------------- 
                Ekadhika of 364 is 365------ 
b) Ekanyuna means ‘one less’ 
    e.g:   Ekanyuna of  1 2 3 ..... 8 ..... 14 .....69 ...... 
                  is               0 1 2 ..... 7 ......13 .... 68 ...... 
c) Purak means ‘ complement’ 
    e.g:   purak of   1 2 3 ..... 8., 9 from 10 
                  is            9 8 7 ..... 2 1 
d) Rekhank means ‘a digit with a bar on its top’. In other words it is a negative 
number. 
 
                                     _ 
         e.g:  A bar on 7 is 7. It is called rekhank 7 or bar 7. We treat purak as 
aRekhank. 
               _              _ 
        e.g: 7 is 3 and 3 is 7 
    At some instances we write negative numbers also with a bar on the top of 
the numbers as 
                                             _ 
               -4 can be shown as 4. 
                                               __ 
               -21 can be shown as 21. 
e) Addition and subtraction using Rekhank. 
    Adding a bar-digit i.e. Rekhank to a digit means the digit is subtracted. 
                         _              _               _ 
          e.g:  3 + 1 = 2, 5 + 2 = 3, 4 + 4 = 0

117 
 
    Subtracting a bar - digit i.e. Rekhank to a digit means the digit is added. 
                      _               _              _ 
          e.g: 4 - 1 = 5, 6 - 2 = 8, 3 - 3 = 6 
    1. Some more examples 
     e.g:  3 + 4 = 7 
                                    _     _    _ 
               (-2) + (-5) = 2 + 5 = 7 or -7 
f) Multiplication and Division using rekhank. 
1. Product of two positive digits or two negative digits ( Rekhanks )  
                                _     _ 
        e.g: 2 X 4 = 8; 4 X 3 = 12 i.e. always positive 
2. Product of one positive digit and one Rekhank 
                     _     _         _            __ 
        e.g: 3 x 2 = 6 or -6; 5 X 3 = 15 or -15 i.e. always Rekhank or negative. 
3. Division of one positive by another or division of one Rekhank by 
anotherRekhank. 
                                _        _ 
        e.g: 8 ÷ 2 = 4, 6 ÷ 3 = 2 i.e. always positive 
4. Division of a positive by a Rekhank or vice versa. 
              __        _       _  _ 
        e.g:  10 ÷ 5 = 2, 6 ÷ 2 = 3 i.e. always negative or Rekhank. 
g) Beejank: The Sum of the digits of a number is called Beejank. If the 
addition is a two digit number, Thenthese two digits are also to be added up to 
get a single digit. 
  e.g: Beejank of 27 is 2 + 7 = 9. 
         Beejank of 348 is 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 
         Further 1 + 5 = 6. i.e. 6 is Beejank. 
         Beejank of 1567 
1 + 5 + 6 + 7 
19 
1 + 9 
1 
         i.e. Beejank of 1567 is 1.

118 
 
ii) Easy way of finding Beejank: 
Beejank is unaffected if 9 is added to or subtracted from the number. This 
nature of 9 helps in finding Beejank very quickly, by cancelling 9 or the digits 
adding to 9 from the number. 
eg 1: Find the Beejank of 632174. 
        As above we have to follow 
        632174 
6 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 4 
23 
2 + 3 
5 
But a quick look gives 6 & 3 ; 2 & 7 are to be ignored because 6+3=9,2+7=9. 
Hence remaining 1 + 4  
5 is the beejank of 632174. 
eg 2: 
Beejank of 1256847 
1+2+5+6+8+4+7 
33 
3+3 
6. 
But we can cancel 1& 8, 2& 7, 5 & 4 because in each case the sum is 9. Hence 
remaining 6 is the Beejank. 
h) Check by Beejank method: 
The Vedic sutra - Gunita Samuccayah gives ‘the whole product is same’. We 
apply this sutra in this context as follows. It means that the operations carried 
out with the numbers have same effect when the same operations are carried 
out with their Beejanks. 
Observe the following examples. 
i) 42 + 39 
Beejanks of 42 and 39 are respectively 4 + 2 = 6 and 3 + 9 = 12 and 1+2=3 
Now 6 + 3 = 9 is the Beejank of the sum of the two numbers 
Further 42 + 39 = 81. Its Beejank is 8+ 1 = 9. 
we have checked the correctness. 
ii)   64 + 125. 
 
           64 
6 + 4

1 + 0

           125 
1 + 2 + 5

119 
 
    Sum of these Beejanks 8 + 1 = 9 
    Note that 
 
            64 + 125 = 189 
1 + 8 + 9 
18 
1 + 8

we have checked the correctness. 
iii)  134 - 49

ix) Beejank in Division: 
Let P, D, Q and R be respectively the dividend, the divisor, the quotient and the 
remainder. 
Further the relationship between them is P = ( Q X D ) + R 
eg 1:  187 ÷ 5 
we know that 187 = ( 37 X 5 ) + 2 now the Beejank check. 
We know that 187 = (37 X 5) +2 now the Beejank check.

Check the following results by Beejank method 
 
        1.  67 + 34 + 82 = 183          2.  4381 - 3216 = 1165 
 
        3.  632 = 3969                        4.  (1234)2 = 1522756 
 
        5.  (86X17) + 34 = 1496     6.  2556 ÷ 127 gives Q =20, R = 16 
 
i) Vinculum : The numbers which by presentation contains both positive and 
negative digits are called vinculum numbers. 
 
ii) Conversion of general numbers into vinculum numbers.  
We obtain them by converting the digits which are 5 and above 5 or less than 5 
without changing the value of that number. 
Consider a number say 8. (Note it is greater than 5). Use it complement (purak 
- rekhank) from 10. It is 2 in this case and add 1 to the left (i.e. tens place) of 
8. 
                             _ 
    Thus  8 = 08 = 12. 
 
    The number 1 contains both positive and negative digits

122 
 
                   _           _ 
    i.e. 1 and 2 . Here 2 is in unit place hence it is -2 and value of 1 at tens place 
is 10. 
              _ 
    Thus 12 = 10 - 2 = 8 
 
Conveniently we can think and write in the following way

The sutras ‘Nikhilam Navatascharamam Dasatah’ and ‘Ekadhikena purvena’ are 
useful for conversion. 
eg 1:  289, Edadhika of 2 is 3

        ‘Nikhilam’ from 9 (of 776) 223

        ‘Charmam from 10 (of 8)  2

        Vinculum of 47168 is 5 2232 
eg 3:  11276. 
Here digits 11 are smaller. We need not convert. Now apply for 276 the two 
sutras Ekadhika of 2 is 3 
                                            __ 
     ‘Nikhilam Navata’ for 76 is 24

123 
 
                            __ 
        11276 = 11324 
                __                
      i.e. 11324 = 11300 - 24 = 11276. 
The conversion can also be done by the sutra sankalana vyavakalanabhyam as 
follows. 
eg 4:  315. 
sankalanam (addition) = 315+315 = 630. 
                                                                       _ 
     Vyvakalanam (subtraction) = 630 - 315 = 325 
 
     Working steps :          _ 
                           0 - 5 = 5 
 
                           3 - 1 = 2 
 
                           6 - 3 = 3 
Let’s apply this sutra in the already taken example 47768. 
Samkalanam = 47768 + 47768 = 95536 
Vyavakalanam = 95536 - 47768. 
 
             
 
Consider the convertion by sankalanavyavakalanabhyam and check it by 
Ekadhika and Nikhilam. 
eg 5: 12637 
1. Sankalana ....... gives,  12637 + 12637 = 25274 
                                                                                                             _ _ 
        25274 – 12637 = (2 – 1) / (5 – 2) / (2 – 6) / (7 – 3) / (4 – 7) = 13443

124 
 
2. Ekadhika and Nikhilam gives the following. 
As in the number 1 2 6 3 7, the smaller and bigger digits (i.e. less than 5 and; 
5, greater than 5) are mixed up, we split up in to groups and conversion is 
made up as given below. 
Split 1 2 6 and 3 7 
                                                  _               _ 
     Now the sutra gives 1 2 6 as 134 and 37 as 43 
                              _  _ 
     Thus  12637 = 13443 
                                                                                                       _ 
    Now for the number 315 we have already obtained vinculum as 325 by 
"sankalana ... " Now by ‘Ekadhika and Nikhilam ...’ we also get the same 
answer. 
315 Since digits of 31 are less than 5, 
We apply the sutras on 15 only as 
Ekadhika of 1 is 2 and Charman of 5 is 5 . 
Consider another number which comes under the split process. 
eg 6:   24173 
As both bigger and smaller numbers are mixed up we split the number 24173 
as 24 and 173 and write their vinculums by Ekadhika and Nikhilam sutras as  
                 _                    __ 
        24 = 36 and 173 = 227 
                              _    __ 
        Thus 24173 = 36227 
 
Convert the following numbers into viniculum number by 
    i. Ekadhika and Nikhilam sutras  ii. Sankalana vyavakalana sutra. 
Observe whether in any case they give the same answer or not. 
 
        1.  64                     2.  289            3.  791 
 
        4.  2879                 5.  19182         6.  823672 
 
        7. 123456799        8.  65384738

125 
 
ii) Conversion of vinculum number into general numbers.  
The process of conversion is exactly reverse to the already done. Rekhanks are 
converted by Nikhilam where as other digits by ‘Ekanyunena’ sutra. thus: 
     _  
i) 12 = (1 – 1) / (10 – 2) Ekanyunena 1 – 1 
                                                 _ 
        = 08 = 8               Nikhilam. 2 = 10 – 2 
     __ 
ii) 326 = (3 – 1) / (9 – 2) / (10 – 6) 
 
          = 274 
      _  _ 
iii) 3344 = (3 – 1) / (10 – 3) / (4 – 1) / (10 – 4) 
 
            = 2736         (note the split) 
        __ __   
iv) 20340121 = 2/(0–1)/(9–3)/(10–4)/(0–1)/(9–1)/(10–2)/1 
                        _   _ 
                   = 21661881 
                        _          _ 
                   = 21 / 6 / 61 / 881. once again split 
 
                   = (2 – 1) / (10 –1) / 6 / (6 –1) / (10 –1) / 881 
 
                   = 19659881 
         ___ 
v)  303212 = 3 / 0321 / 2 
 
                = 3 / (0-1) / (9-3) / (9-2) / (10-1) / 2 
                        _ 
                   3 / 1 / 6792 
 
                   (3 –1) / (10 –1) / 6792 
 
                = 296792. 
 
iii) Single to many conversions. 
It is interesting to observe that the conversions can be shown in many ways. 
eg 1:  86 can be expressed in following many ways 
                             __ 
        86 = 90 - 4 =94 
                                  __ 
            = 100 – 14 = 114

126 
 
                                      ___  
            = 1000 – 914 = 1914 
                      _      __      ___      ____ 
    Thus 86 = 94 = 114 = 1914 = 19914 = …………. 
eg 2 : 
                  _                     _ 
                07 = -10 +3 = 13 
                 __                       _ 
               36 = -100 + 64 = 164 
               ___                         _ 
              978 = -1000 + 22 = 1022. etc.,  
 
* Convert by Vedic process the following numbers into vinculum 
numbers. 
 
        1)  274        2)  4898         3)  60725        4)  876129. 
* Convert the following vinculum numbers into general form of 
numbers ( normalized form) 
 
        1) 283        2)  3619          3) 27216 
 
        4) 364718                          5) 60391874 
 
(iv) Vedic check for conversion: 
The vedic sutra "Gunita Samuctayah" can be applied for verification of the 
conversion by Beejank method. 
Consider a number and find its Beejank. Find the vinculum number by the 
conversion and find its Beejank. If both are same the conversion is correct. 
eg. 
                       _ 
            196 = 216 . Now Beejank of 196
 1 + 6 
7 
Beejank of 216 
2 + ( -1 ) + 6 
7.    Thus verified. 
But there are instances at which, if beejank of vinculum number is rekhank i.e. 
negative. Then it is to be converted to +ve number by adding 9 to Rekhank (

127 
 
already we have practised) and hence 9 is taken as zero, or vice versa in finding 
Beejank. 
eg: 
             __ 
            213 = 200 - 13= 187 
                                     _ 
            Now Beejank of 213 = 2 + ( -1 ) + (-3 ) = -2 
 
            Beejank of 187 = 1 + 8 + 7 = 16
 1 + 6 = 7 
The variation in answers can be easily understood as 
                           _    _ 
                           2 = 2 + 9 
- 2 + 9 = 7 Hence verified. 
 
Use Vedic check method of the verification of the following result. 
                       _                                   _  _ 
        1.  24 = 36               2.  2736 = 3344. 
              __                            _  _ 
        3.  326 = 274           4.  23213 = 17187</B< p> 
 
Addition and subtraction using vinculum numbers. 
eg 1:  Add 7 and 6 i.e., 7+6. 
i) Change the numbers as vinculum numbers as per rules already discussed. 
                          _              _ 
               { 7 = 13 and 6 = 14 } 
ii) Carry out the addition column by column in the normal process, moving from 
top to bottom or vice versa. 
 
               
 
iii) add the digits of the next higher level i.e.,, 1 + 1 = 2 
                         _ 
                       13

                         _ 
                       27 
iv) the obtained answer is to be normalized as per rules already explained. rules 
already explained. 
               _ 
        i.e., 27 = (2 - 1) (10- 7) = 13 Thus we get 7 + 6 = 13. 
eg 2 : Add 973 and 866. 
                                 _                              _ 
                  973 = 1 0 3 3                     1 0 3 3 
                               _ __                       _ _ _ 
                  866 = 1 1 3 4                     1 1 3 4 
                                                            ______ 
                                                               _ _ _

                   ___ 
            But 2161 = 2000 - 161 = 1839. 
Thus 973+866 by vinculum method gives 1839 which is correct. 
Observe that in this representation the need to carry over from the previous 
digit to the next higher level is almost not required. 
eg 3 : Subtract 1828 from 4247. 
 
            i.e.,,  4247 
                  -1828 
                  ______

        since 7 + 8 = 1, 4 + 2 = 2, 2 + 8 =6, 4 + 1 = 3 
                                              _  _ 
         (iii) Changing the answer 3621 into normal form using Nikhilam, we get

2. Addition and Subtraction 
ADDITION: 
    In the convention process we perform the process as follows. 
234 + 403 + 564 + 721 
write as  234 
                 403 
                 564 
                 721 
Step (i): 4 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 12     2 retained and 1 is carried over to left. 
Step (ii): 3 + 0 + 6 + 2 = 11    the carried ‘1’ is added 
i.e., Now 2 retained as digit in the second place (from right to left) of the answer and 1 is 
carried over to left. 
step (iii): 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 18    carried over ‘1’ is added 
i.e., 18 + 1 = 19. As the addition process ends, the same 19 is retained in the left had most 
part of the answer. 
thus    234 
              403 
              564 
             +721 
             _____  
              1922   is the answer 
we follow sudhikaran process Recall ‘sudha’ i.e., dot (.) is taken as an upa-sutra (No: 15) 
consider the same example 
 
              
 
i) Carry out the addition column by column in the usual fashion, moving from bottom to top. 
(a) 1 + 4 = 5, 5 + 3 = 8, 8 + 4 = 12 The final result is more than 9. The tenth place ‘1’ is 
dropped once number in the unit place i.e., 2 retained. We say at this stage sudha and a 
dot is above the top 4. Thus column (1) of addition (right to left)

131 
 
      . 
         4 
         3 
         4  
         1 
        __ 
         2  
 
b) Before coming to column (2) addition, the number of dots are to be counted, This shall 
be added to the bottom number of column (2) and we proceed as above.  
Thus second column becomes 
            . 
           3        dot=1,    1 + 2 = 3 
           0                     3 + 6 = 9 
           6                     9 + 0 = 9 
           2                     9 + 3 = 12 
           __ 
            2 
2 retained and ‘.’ is placed on top number 3 
 
c) proceed as above for column (3) 
 
 2      i)dot = 1          ii) 1 + 7 = 8 
 4      iii)8 + 5 = 13    iv) Sudha is said. 
 . 
 5      A dot is placed on 5 and proceed 
 7      with retained unit place 3. 
__ 
 9      v) 3+4=7,7+2=9 Retain 9 in 3rd digit i.e.,in 100th place. 
 
d) Now the number of dots is counted. Here it is 1 only and the number is carried out left 
side ie. 1000th place 
                .. 
    Thus    234 
              403 
              . 
              564 
             +721 
             _____ 
             1922    is the answer. 
Though it appears to follow the conventional procedure, a careful observation and practice 
gives its special use.

132 
 
eg (1): 
                 . 
              437 
              .  . 
              624 
                . 
              586 
             +162 
            ______ 
              1809 
 
Steps 1: 
i) 2 + 6 = 8, 8 + 4 = 12 so a dot on 4 and 2 + 7 = 9 the answer retained under column (i) 
ii) One dot from column (i) treated as 1, is carried over to column (ii), 
thus 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 8 = 15 A' dot’; is placed on 8 for the 1 in 15 and the 5 in 15 is added to 
2 above. 
5 + 2 = 7, 7 + 3 = 10 i.e. 0 is written under column (ii) and a dot for the carried over 1 of 
10 is placed on the top of 3. 
(iii) The number of dots counted in column (iii) are 2. 
Hence the number 2 is carried over to column (ii) Now in column (iii) 
2 + 1 = 3, 3 + 5 = 8, 8 + 6 = 14 A dot for 1 on the number 6 and 4 is retained to be added 
4 above to give 8. Thus 8 is placed under column (iii). 
iv) Finally the number of dots in column (iii) are counted. It is ‘1’ only. So it carried over to 
1000th place. As there is no fourth column 1 is the answer for 4th column. Thus the answer 
is 1809. 
Example 3: 
 
                     
 
Check the result verify these steps with the procedure mentioned above. 
The process of addition can also be done in the down-ward direction i.e., addition of 
numbers column wise from top to bottom

133 
 
Example 1: 
 
                   
 
Step 1:    6 + 4 = 10, 1 dot ; 0 + 8 = 8; 8 + 4 = 12; 
            1 dot and 2 answer under first column - total 2 dots. 
Step 2:  2+2 (
 2 dots) = 4; 4+9 = 13: 1 dot and 3+0= 3; 3+8 = 11; 
     1 dot and 1 answer under second column - total 2 dots. 
Step 3:  3+2 (
 2 dots ) = 5; 5+6 = 11:1 dot and 1+7 = 8; 8+7 = 15; 
     1 dot and 5 under third column as answer - total 2 dots. 
Step 4:  4 + 2 (
 2 dots ) = 6; 6 + 5 =11: 
     1 dot and 1+3 = 4; 4+2 = 6. - total 1 dot in the fourth 6 column as answer. 
Step 5:  1 dot in the fourth column carried over to 5th column (No digits in it) as 1 
     Thus answer is from Step5 to Step1;16512 
Example 2: 
 
                   
 
Steps 
    (i):  8 + 9 = 17; 7 + 4 = 11; 1 + 1 = (2) 
(2dots) 
    (ii): 7 + 2 = 9; 9 + 1 = 10; 0 + 8 = 8, 8 + 9 = 17, (7)
 (2dots) 
    (iii): 2 + 2 = 4; 4 + 6 = 10; 0 + 0 = 0; 0 + 7 = (7)
 (1 dot) 
    (iv): 3 + 1 = 4; 4 + 4 = 8; 8 + 3 = 11; 1 + 1 = (2)
 (1 dot) 
    (v): 1

134 
 
        Thus answer is 12772.

SUBTRACTION: 
The ‘Sudha’ Sutra is applicable where the larger digit is to be subtracted from the smaller 
digit. Let us go to the process through the examples. 
Procedure: 
i) If the digit to be subtracted is larger, a dot ( sudha ) is given to its left. 
ii) The purak of this lower digit is added to the upper digit or purak-rekhank of this lower 
digit is subtracted.

Example (i): 34 - 18 
 
                     34 
                     .

                  _____ 
                                                                          . 
     Steps: (i): Since 8>4, a dot is put on its left i.e.1 
          (ii) Purak of 8 i.e. 2 is added to the upper digit i.e. 4 
                                                                        _ 
                   2 + 4 = 6. or Purak-rekhank of 8 i.e. 2 is 
                                                      _ 
                   Subtracted from i.e. 4 - 2 =6. 
Now at the tens place a dot (means1) makes the ‘1’ in the number into 1+1=2.This has to 
be subtracted from above digit. i.e. 3 - 2 = 1. Thus 
 
                     34 
                     . 
                   -18

                     16 
Example 2: 
 
                     63 
                     .

     Steps: (i) 7>3. Hence a dot on left of 7 i.e.,3 
          (ii) Purak of 7 i.e. 3 is added to upper digit 3 i.e. 3+3 = 6. 
 
                    This is unit place of the answer. 
               Thus answer is 26. 
Example (3) : 
 
                     3274 
                     .. 
                    -1892 
                  _______

136 
 
Steps: 
    (i)  2 < 4. No sudha . 4-2 = 2 first digit (form right to left) 
                                                                                      . 
         (ii) 9 > 7 sudha required. Hence a dot on left of 9 i.e. 8  
 
         (iii) purak of 9 i.e. 1, added to upper 7 gives1 + 7 = 8 second digit 
                                   . 
         (iv) Now means 8 + 1 = 9. 
                                                                                                      . 
         (v) As 9 > 2, once again the same process: dot on left of i.e.,1  
 
         (vi) purak of 9 i.e. 1, added to upper 2 gives1 + 2 = 3, the third digit.  
                        . 
         (vii) Now 1 means 1+1 = 2 
 
         (viii) As 2 < 3, we have 3-2 = 1, the fourth digit 
Thus answer is 1382

Mixed addition and subtraction using Rekhanks: 
Example 1 : 423 - 654 + 847 - 126 + 204. 
In the conventional method we first add all the +ve terms 
 
                       423 + 847 + 204 = 1474 
Next we add all negative terms 
                - 654 - 126 = -780 
At the end their difference is taken 
               1474 - 780 = 694 
Thus in 3 steps we complete the problem 
But in Vedic method using Rekhank we write and directly find the answer.

3. Multiplication 
We have already observed the application of Vedic sutras in multiplication. Let us recall 
them. 
It enables us to have a comparative study of the applicability of these methods, to assess 
advantage of one method over the other method and so-on. 
Example (i) :  Find the square of 195. 
The Conventional method :  
 
            1952   =        195 
                            x 195 
                            ______ 
                               975 
                            1755 
                            195 
                           _______ 
                            38025 
                           ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ 
(ii) By Ekadhikena purvena, since the number ends up in 5 we write the answer split up 
into two parts. 
The right side part is 52 where as the left side part 19 X (19+1) (Ekhadhikena) 
Thus 1952 = 19 X 20/52 = 380/25 = 38025 
(iii) By Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah; as the number is far from base 100, we 
combine the sutra with the upa-sutra ‘anurupyena’ and proceed by taking working base 
200. 
a) Working Base = 200 = 2 X 100. 
    Now 1952 = 195 X 195 
            
 
iv) By the sutras "yavadunam tavadunikritya vargamca yojayet" and "anurupyena" 
    1952, base 200 treated as 2 X 100 deficit is 5.

140 
 
            
 
v) By ‘antyayor dasakepi’ and ‘Ekadhikena’ sutras 
    Since in 195 x 195, 5 + 5 = 10 gives 
    1952 = 19 x 20 / 5 x 5 = 380 / 25 = 38025. 
vi) Now "urdhva-tiryagbhyam" gives 
 
 
   
 
By the carryovers the answer is 38025 
 
Example 2 : 98 X 92 
i) ‘Nikhilam’ sutra 
 
                          98    -2 
                      x  92    -8 
                   ______________ 
                     90 / 16 = 9016 
ii) ‘Antyayordasakepi’ and ‘Ekadhikena’ sutras. 
    98 X 92 Last digit sum= 8+2 =10 remaining digit (s) = 9 samesutras work. 
    
98 X 92 = 9 X ( 9 + 1) / 8X2 = 90/16 = 9016.

1) ‘Nikhilam’ Method and ‘Anurupyena’: 
a) Working base is 500, treated as 5 X 100 
 
               
 
b) Working base is 500, treated as 1000 / 2

              _________ 
               245 / 021    =  245021 
2) ‘Urdhva tiryak’ sutra. 
 
        
 
3) Since end digits sum is 3+7 = 10 and remaining part 49 is same in both the numbers, 
‘antyayordasakepi’ is applicable. Further Ekadhikena Sutra is also applicable. 
Thus 
 
            493 x 497 =49 x 50 / 3x7 
                         = 2450 / 21 
                         = 245021 
4) With the use of vinculum. 
                                         _ 
            493 = 500 –07 = 507

Deficiency is 1 : It indicates 992 = (99 – 1) / 12 = 98 / 01 = 9801. 
In the above examples we have observed how in more than one way problems can be 
solved and also the variety. You can have your own choice for doing multiplication. Not only 
that which method suits well for easier and quicker calculations. Thus the element of choice, 
divergent thinking, insight into properties and patterns in numbers, natural way of 
developing an idea, resourcefulness play major role in Vedic Mathematics methods.

4. Division 
In the conventional procedure for division, the process is of the following form. 
 
                         Quotient 
                         _______ 
             Divisor ) Dividend       or    Divisor ) Dividend ( Quotient 
                         ----------                         ---------- 
                         ----------                         ---------- 
                         _________                       _________ 
                         Remainder                         Remainder 
        But in the Vedic process, the format is 
 
                           Divisor ) Dividend 
                                        -------- 
                                        -------- 
                               __________________ 
                               Quotient / Remainder 
The conventional method is always the same irrespective of the divisor. But Vedic methods 
are different depending on the nature of the divisor. 
Example 1: Consider the division 1235 ÷ 89. 
i) Conventional method: 
 
                   89 ) 1235 ( 13 
                            89 
                         _____ 
                          345 
                          267     Thus Q = 13 and R = 78. 
                         _____ 
                           78 
ii) Nikhilam method: 
This method is useful when the divisor is nearer and less than the base. Since for 89, the 
base is 100 we can apply the method. Let us recall the nikhilam division already dealt. 
Step (i): 
    Write the dividend and divisor as in the conventional method. Obtain the modified divisor 
(M.D.) applying the Nikhilam formula. Write M.D. just below the actual divisor. 
Thus for the divisor 89, the M.D. obtained by using Nikhilam is 11 in the last from 10 and 
the rest from 9. Now Step 1 gives  
 
               89 ) 1235 
               __ 
               11

145 
 
Step (ii): 
    Bifurcate the dividend by by a slash so that R.H.S of dividend contains the number of 
digits equal to that of M.D. Here M.D. contains 2 digits hence 
 
               89 ) 12 / 35 
               __ 
               11 
Step (iii): Multiply the M.D. with first column digit of the dividend. Here it is 1. i.e. 11 x 1 = 
11. Write this product place wise under the 2nd and 3rd columns of the dividend.  
 
               89 ) 12 / 35 
               __ 
               11     1   1 
Step (iv): 
    Add the digits in the 2nd column and multiply the M.D. with that result i.e. 2+1=3 and 
11x3=33. Write the digits of this result column wise as shown below, under 3rd and 4th 
columns. i.e. 
 
               89 ) 12 / 35 
               __ 
               11     1   1 
                            33 
                     _______ 
                     13 / 78 
Now the division process is complete, giving Q = 13 and R = 78. 
Example 2:  Find Q and R for 121134 ÷ 8988. 
Steps (1+2):  
 
                   8988 ) 12 / 1134 
                   ____ 
                   1012 
Step (3): 
 
                   8988 ) 12 / 1134 
                   ____ 
                   1012     1    012

146 
 
Step(4): 
 
                   8988 ) 12 / 1134 
                   ____ 
                   1012      1  012     [ 2+ 1 = 3 and 3x1012 = 3036 ] 
 
                                   3036 
Now final Step 
 
                   8988 ) 12 / 1134 
                   ____ 
                   1012    1     012 
 
                                   3036(Column wise addition) 
                            _________ 
                             13 / 4290 
Thus 121134¸ 8988 gives Q = 13 and R = 4290. 
iii) Paravartya method: Recall that this method is suitable when the divisor is nearer but 
more than the base. 
Example 3: 32894 ÷ 1028. 
The divisor has 4 digits. So the last 3 digits of the dividend are set apart for the remainder 
and the procedure follows. 
 
              
 
Now the remainder contains -19, -12 i.e. negative quantities. Observe that 32 is quotient. 
Take 1 over from the quotient column i.e. 1x1028 = 1028 over to the right side and 
proceed thus: 32 - 1 = 31 becomes the Q and R = 1028+200 - 190 - 12 =1028-2 =1026. 
Thus 3289 ÷ 1028 gives Q = 31 and R = 1026. 
The same problem can be presented or thought of in any one of the following forms.

147 
 
               
 
                                                                                                           _ 
     *Converting the divisor 1028 into vinculum number we get 1028 = 1032 Now 
 
                 
 
                                                                                              __ 
     *Converting dividend into vinculum number 32894 = 33114 and proceeding we get  
 
                      
 
Now we take another process of division based on the combination of Vedic sutras urdhva-
tiryak and Dhvjanka. The word Dhvjanka means " on the top of the flag" 
Example 4: 43852 ÷ 54. 
Step1: Put down the first digit (5) of the divisor (54) in the divisor column as operator and 
the other digit (4) as flag digit. Separate the dividend into two parts where the right part 
has one digit. This is because the falg digit is single digit. The representation is as follows. 
 
                   4 : 4 3 8 5 : 2 
                 5

148 
 
Step2:  i) Divide 43 by the operator 5. Now Q= 8 and R = 3. Write this Q=8 as the 1st 
Quotient - digit and prefix R=3, before the next digit i.e. 8 of the dividend, as shown below. 
Now 38 becomes the gross-dividend ( G.D. ) for the next step. 
 
                   4 : 4 3  8 5 : 2  
                 5   :     3 
               ________________ 
                      :   8 
ii) Subtract the product of falg digit (4) and first quotient digit (8) from the G.D. (38) i.e. 
38-(4X8)=38-32=6. This is the net - dividend (N.D) for the next step. 
Step3: Now N.D Operator gives Q and R as follows. 6 ÷ 5, Q = 1, R = 1. So Q = 1, the 
second quotient-digit and R - 1, the prefix for the next digit (5) of the dividend. 
 
                  4 : 4 3  8  5 : 2  
                5   :     3  1 
               ________________ 
                     :   8  1 
Step4: Now G.D = 15; product of flag-digit (4) and 2nd quotient - digit (1) is 4X1=4 Hence 
N.D=15-4=11 divide N.D by 5 to get 11 ÷ 5, Q = 2, R= 1. The representation is 
 
               4 : 4 3  8  5 : 2  
              5  :     3   1  :1 
           ________________ 
                  :   8  1  2 : 
Step5: Now the R.H.S part has to be considered. The final remainder is obtained by 
subtracting the product of falg-digit (4)and third quotient digit (2) form 12 i.e., 12: 
Final remainder = 12 - (4 X 2) = 12 - 8 = 4. Thus the division ends into  
 
               4 : 4 3  8  5 : 2  
              5  :     3  1   :1 
            ________________ 
                  :   8  1  2 : 4 
Thus 43852 ÷ 54 gives Q = 812 and R = 4. 
Consider the algebraic proof for the above problem. The divisor 54 can be represented by 
5x+4, where x=10 
The dividend 43852 can be written algebraically as 43x3 + 8x2 + 5x + 2 
since x3 = 103 = 1000, x2 = 102 = 100.

149 
 
Now the division is as follows. 
 
            5x + 4 ) 43x3+ 8x2 + 5x + 2 ( 8x2 + x + 2 
                       43x3+ 32x2 
                      _________________ 
                        3x3 – 24x2 
                     = 6x2 + 5x        (
3x3 = 3 . x . x2 
                        5x2 + 4x                   = 3 . 10x2 = 30 x2) 
                      _________________ 
                          x2 + x 
                     = 11x + 2        ( 
x2 = x . x = 10x ) 
                        10x + 8 
                      __________________ 
                           x – 6 
 
                            = 10 – 6 
                            = 4. 
Observe the following steps: 
1. 43x3 ÷ 5x gives first quotient term 8x2 , remainder =3x3 - 24x2 which really mean 30x2 + 
8x2 -32x2 = 6x2. 
    Thus in step 2 of the problem 43852 ÷ 54, we get Q= 8 and N.D = 6. 
2. 6x2 ÷ 5x gives second quotient term x, remainder = x2 + x which really mean 10x + x = 
11x. 
    Thus in step 3 & Step 4, we get Q=1and N.D =11. 
3. 11x ÷ 5x gives third quotient term 2, remainder = x - 6 , which really mean the final 
remainder 10-6=4. 
Example 5: Divide 237963 ÷ 524 
Step1: We take the divisor 524 as 5, the operator and 24, the flag-digit and proceed as in 
the above example. We now seperate the dividend into two parts where the RHS part 
contains two digits for Remainder. 
Thus  
            24 : 2 3 7 9: 63 
           5 
Step2: 
    i) 23÷5 gives Q = 4 and R = 3, G.D = 37.

150 
 
    ii) N.D is obtained as  
                                   
 
 
                                = 37 – ( 8 + 0) 
                                = 29.

                               : 4 
Step3: 
    i) N.D ÷ Operator = 29 ÷ 5 gives Q = 5, R = 4 and G.D = 49. 
    ii) N.D is obtained as 
                                  
  
 
                                 = 49 – (10 + 16) 
                                 = 49 – 26 
                                 = 23. 
 
            i.e., 
                  24 : 2 3  7  9 : 63 
                 5    :     3  4   : 
                _________________ 
                       :  4   5     : 
Step 4: 
    i) N.D ÷ Operator = 23 ÷ 5 gives Q = 4, R = 3 and G.D = 363. 
    Note that we have reached the remainder part thus 363 is total sub–remainder. 
 
                   24 : 2 3  7  9 : 63 
                  5    :     3  4   :3 
                 _________________ 
                        :   4  5  4  : 
Step 5: We find the final remainder as follows. Subtract the cross-product of the two, falg-
digits and two last quotient-digits and then vertical product of last flag-digit with last 
quotient-digit from the total sub-remainder.

151 
 
i.e.,, 
               
 
Note that 2, 4 are two falg digits: 5, 4 are two last quotient digits: 
        
 
     represents the last flag - digit and last quotient digit. 
Thus the division 237963 ÷ 524 gives Q = 454 and R = 67. 
Thus the Vedic process of division which is also called as Straight division is a simple 
application of urdhva-tiryak together with dhvajanka. This process has many uses along 
with the one-line presentation of the answer. 
 
5. Miscellaneous Items 
1. Straight Squaring: 
We have already noticed methods useful to find out squares of numbers. But the methods 
are useful under some situations and conditions only. Now we go to a more general formula. 
The sutra Dwandwa-yoga (Duplex combination process) is used in two different meanings. 
They are i) by squaring ii) by cross-multiplying. 
We use both the meanings of Dwandwa-yoga in the context of finding squares of numbers 
as follows: 
We denote the Duplex of a number by the symbol D. We define for a single digit ‘a’, D =a2. 
and for a two digit number of the form ‘ab’, D=2( a x b ). If it is a 3 digit number like ‘abc’, 
D =2( a x c ) + b2. 
For a 4 digit number ‘abcd’, D = 2( a x d ) + 2( b x c ) and so on. i.e. if the digit is single 
central digit, D represents ‘square’: and for the case of an even number of digits equidistant 
from the two ends D represent the double of the cross- product.

152 
 
Consider the examples: 
 
 Number 
  DuplexD 
  
  
       3 
 32 = 9 
       6 
 62 = 36 
     23 
 2 (2 x 3) = 12 
     64 
 2 (6 x 4) = 48 
   128 
 2 (1 x 8) + 22 = 16 + 4 = 20 
   305 
 2 (3 x 5) + 02 = 30 + 0 = 30 
 4231 
 2 (4 x 1) + 2 (2 x 3) = 8 + 12 = 20 
 7346 
 2 (7 x 6) + 2 (3 x 4) = 84 + 24 = 108 
Further observe that for a n- digit number, the square of the number contains 2n or 2n-1 
digits. Thus in this process, we take extra dots to the left one less than the number of digits 
in the given numbers. 
Examples:1  622  Since number of digits = 2, we take one extra dot to the left. Thus 
 
                   .62         for 2, D = 22 = 4

                                      ...1426,  D = 12 = 1 
 
                   Thus 14262 = 2033476. 
With a little bit of practice the results can be obtained mentally as a single line answer. 
Algebraic Proof: 
Consider the first example 622 
 
        Now 622 = (6 x 10 + 2)2 =(10a + b)2 where a = 6, b = 2 
                                            = 100a2 + 2.10a.b + b2 
                                            = a2 (100) + 2ab (10) + b2 
i.e. b2 in the unit place, 2ab in the 10th place and a2 in the100th place i.e. 22 = 4 in units 
place, 2.6.2 = 24 in the10th place (4 in the 10th place and with carried over to 100th place). 
62=36 in the 100th place and with carried over 2 the 100th place becomes 36+2=38. 
    Thus the answer 3844.

2.CUBING 
Take a two digit number say 14. 
i) Find the ratio of the two digits i.e. 1:4 
 
ii) Now write the cube of the first digit of the number i.e. 13 
 
iii) Now write numbers in a row of 4 terms in such a way that the first one is the cube of the 
first digit and remaining three are obtained in a geometric progression with common ratio 
as the ratio of the original two digits (i.e. 1:4) i.e. the row is 
 
                          1    4    16    64. 
 
iv) Write twice the values of 2nd and 3rd terms under the terms respectively in second row. 
 
i.e., 
        1    4    16    64 
              8    32           (
 2 x 4 = 8, 2 x 16 = 32)

154 
 
v) Add the numbers column wise and follow carry over process. 
 
        1    4    16    64    Since 16 + 32 + 6 (carryover) = 54 
              8    32           4 written and 5 (carryover) + 4 + 8 = 17

Algebraic Proof:

155 
 
Let a and b be two digits. 
Consider the row a3     a2b    ab2     b3 
     the first isa3 and the numbers are in the ratio a:b 
    since a3:a2b=a2b:b3=a:b 
Now twice of a2b, ab2 are 2a2b, 2ab2 
 
            a3 +  a2b + ab2 + b3 
                  2a2b + 2ab2 
             ________________________________ 
            a3 +3a2b + 3ab2 + b3 = (a + b)3. 
Thus cubes of two digit numbers can be obtained very easily by using the vedic sutra 
‘anurupyena’. Now cubing can be done by using the vedic sutra ‘Yavadunam’. 
Example 3:   Consider 1063. 
i) The base is 100 and excess is 6. In this context we double the excess and then add. 
    i.e. 106 + 12 = 118. ( 
2 X 6 =12 ) 
    This becomes the left - hand - most portion of the cube. 
    i.e. 1063 = 118 / - - - - 
ii) Multiply the new excess by the initial excess 
 
         i.e. 18 x 6 = 108 (excess of 118 is 18) 
    Now this forms the middle portion of the product of course 1 is carried over, 08 in the 
middle.   
 
         i.e. 1063 = 118 / 08 / - - - - - 
                            1 
iii) The last portion of the product is cube of the initial excess. 
    i.e. 63 = 216. 
    16 in the last portion and 2 carried over. 
 
         i.e. 1063 = 118 / 081 /16 = 1191016 
                            1      2 
Example 4:  Find 10023. 
i) Base = 1000. Excess = 2. Left-hand-most portion of the cube becomes 
1002+(2x2)=1006.

156 
 
ii) New excess x initial excess = 6 x 2 = 12. 
    Thus 012 forms the middle portion of the cube. 
iii) Cube of initial excess = 23 = 8. 
    So the last portion is 008. 
    Thus 10023 = 1006 / 012 / 008 = 1006012008. 
Example 5:  Find 943. 
i) Base = 100, deficit = -6. Left-hand-most portion of the cube becomes94+(2x-6)=94-
12=82. 
ii) New deficit x initial deficit = -(100-82)x(-6)=-18x-6=108 
    Thus middle potion of the cube = 08 and 1 is carried over. 
iii) Cube of initial deficit = (-6)3 = -216 
                                         __                 __ 
            Now 943 =82 / 08 / 16 = 83 / 06 / 16 
                                    _ 
                             1     2 
                                           = 83 / 05 / (100 – 16) 
                                           = 830584.

3. Equation of Straight line passing through two given points: 
To find the equation of straight line passing through the points (x1,y1) and (x2, y2) , we 
generally consider one of the following methods. 
1. General equation y = mx + c. 
    It is passing through (x1, y1) theny1 = mx1 + c. 
    It is passing through (x2, y2) also, theny2 = mx2 + c. 
    Solving these two simultaneous equations, we get ‘m’ and ‘c’ and so the equation. 
2. The formula 
                                            (y2 - y1)  
                               y – y1 = ________ (x – x1)   and substitution. 
                                             (x2- x1)

Some sequence of steps gives the equation. But the paravartya sutra enables us to arrive at 
the conclusion in a more easy way and convenient to work mentally. 
Example1:  Find the equation of the line passing through the points (9,7) and (5,2). 
Step1: Put the difference of the y - coordinates as the x - coefficient and vice - versa. 
          i.e. x coefficient = 7- 2 = 5 
          y coefficient = 9 - 5 = 4. 
          Thus L.H.S of equation is 5x - 4y. 
Step 2: The constant term (R.H.S) is obtained by substituting the co-ordinates of either of 
the given points in 
        L.H.S (obtained through step-1) 
        i.e. R.H.S of the equation is      
 
             5(9) -4(7) = 45 - 28 = 17 
 
            or 5(5) - 4(2) = 25 - 8 = 17.  
 
            Thus the equation is 5x - 4y = 17. 
Example 2:  Find the equation of the line passing through (2, -3) and (4,-7). 
Step 1 : x[-3-(-7)] –y[2-4] = 4x + 2y. 
Step 2 : 4(2) + 2(-3) = 8 –6 = 2. 
Step 3 : Equation is 4x + 2y =2 or 2x +y = 1. 
Example 3 : Equation of the line passing through the points (7,9) and (3,-7). 
Step 1 : x[9 - (-7)] – y(7 - 3) = 16x - 4y. 
Step 2 : 16(7) - 4(9) = 112 – 36 = 76 
Step 3 : 16x- 4y = 76 or 4x – y = 19

IV Conclusion  
       
After going through the content presented in this book, you may, perhaps, have noted a 
number of applications of methods of Vedic Mathematics. We are aware that this attempt 
is only to make you familiar with a few special methods. The methods discussed, and 
organization of the content here are intended for any reader with some basic 
mathematical background. That is why the serious mathematical issues, higher level 
mathematical problems are not taken up in this volume, even though many aspects like 
four fundamental operations, squaring, cubing, linear equations, simultaneous equations. 
factorization, H.C.F, recurring decimals, etc are dealt with. Many more concepts and 
aspects are omitted unavoidably, keeping in view the scope and limitations of the present 
volume.  
 
Thus the present volume serves as only an 'introduction'. More has to be presented to 
cover all the issues in Swamiji's 'Vedic Mathematics'. Still more steps are needed to touch 
the latest developments in Vedic Mathematics. As a result, serious and sincere work by 
scholars and research workers continues in this field both in our country and abroad. Sri 
Sathya Sai Veda Pratisthan intends to bring about more volumes covering the aspects 
now left over, and also elaborating the content of Vedic Mathematics.  
 
The present volume, even though introductory, has touched almost all the Sutras and 
sub-Sutras as mentioned in Swamiji's 'Vedic Mathematics'. Further it has given rationale 
and proof for the methods. As there is a general opinion that the 'so called Vedic 
Mathematics is only rude, rote, non mathematical and none other than some sort of 
tricks', the logic, proof and Mathematics behind the 'the so called tricks' has been 
explained. An impartial reader can easily experience the beauty, charm and 
resourcefulness in Vedic Mathematics systems. We feel that the reader can enjoy the 
diversity and simplicity in Vedic Mathematics while applying the methods against the 
conventional textbook methods. The reader can also compare and contrast both the 
methods.  
 
The Vedic Methods enable the practitioner improve mental abilities to solve difficult 
problems with high speed and accuracy.
