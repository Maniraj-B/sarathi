Foreword

I was, indeed, delighted to go through
the typescript of Yoga for Children,
written by Rajiv and Swati Chanchani.
Both of them have been my pupils for
a long time and have practised yoga
regularly and sincerely.

After having observed at our Pune
institute the techniques of imparting
the knowledge of Yoga asanas to
children, the authors began teaching
Yoga to children first under the
auspices of the Bharatiya Vidya
Bhavan at Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu,
and later on their own.

On the basis of experience in teaching
Yoga to children between the ages of 7
and 18, and keeping in view the specific
problems or difficulties faced by them,

the authors have undertaken the task
of putting their perceptions in a book
form.

As I read the text, I observed the
interesting and exhilarating way in
which the authors have explained the
eight-limbs of yoga. They have also
introduced seventy five asanas along
with relevant stories to educate and
motivate children to build up an ideal
character and to improve their
physical health and mental well-being.

Nature has gifted children with the
ability to quickly recover from injuries.
Hence, teachers need not be afraid
while teaching them asanas. Moreover,
they have an in-built instinct which
helps them to react instantly to avoid
injuries and muscular damage. They
love speed and variety. If children are
made to perform these asanas with
different combinations and
permutations, they get inspired to do
more and more.

Yoga for Children / 7

In addition to the qualities of speed and
variety, children are also blessed with
innocence and freshness. There is no
jealousy or malice in them. Through
Yoga, it is possible to transform skill-
fully their vanity and competitive spirit
into useful forms of energy. Yoga
channelises their thoughts and makes
them responsible citizens of the world.

I am glad that two of my pupils have
taken the initiative and brought out
this book with stories and diagrams to
convey the message of each asana on an
educative level. These asanas can eas-
ily be taught in schools on a mass scale
as well asin small groups at home or in
clubs.

For children, who are custodians of each
nation in particular and the whole world
at large, I feel Yoga is the essential
product of the twenty first century to
lead them to perfect physical health
and mental well-being.

Yoga for Children / 11

The Beginning

Yoga is an ancient science. N obody knows
its origins. Legends say it began with the
gods. Lord Shiva is described as the first
great yogi. Overtime many wise men
walked the great path of Yoga. Each one

of them left their own landmarks for us to
follow. ,

Many old Indian
stories tell us about,” ‘
these virtuous :
sages and
their wonderful
world. These sages
were like children.
Everything fascinated
them: shining stars, tall
mountains, flowing
rivers, fierce beasts,
beautiful
birds....even.
little
grasshoppers.
These pious men
lived close to nature.
Truth, non-violence,
honesty, self-discipline
and simplicity were the
roots of their life.

Foremost
amongst

these
wise men of old
was the great Sage Patanjali.

Yoga for Children / 13

Sage Patanjali

Se: Sage Patanjaliwas the first person to present
“= Se

Ss Wa the ancient tradition of Yoga in a systematic
S25PY way. Thus he is considered the founder of

Yoga. Patanjali lived around 200 B.C.

There is an interesting story about
Patanjali’s birth. His mother, Gonika, was
a very pious lady. One day while bathing in
the river,Gonika prayed to the sun god, “O
Lord, please grant me a glorious son.”

In answer to her prayers the sun god told
the wise snake Shesha (or Ananta) to take
birth as Gonika’s son. Instantly the great

14 | Yoga for Children

Shesha became a tiny snake and dropped
down into Gonika’s palms which were folded
in prayer. The snake then changed himself
into a beautiful baby boy. Gonika was de-
lighted. She named the child Pata-anjali.
Pata means falling and anjali means palms

folded in prayer.

Patanjali grew up to be an extraordinary
man, renowned for his learning and wis-
dom. He was the author of three brilliant
works. One was on Sanskrit grammar. The
second was a work on ancient Indian

medicine, Ayurveda.

The third and the most important, was on
Yoga. It is called the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
In this brief work, containing only 196 say-
ings, Patanjali clearly explains what Yoga is.

Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

The Meaning of Yoga

The word Yoga means tojoin or unite. In the
Yoga Sutras, Patanjali described Yoga as
the means by which our mind can be made
still, quiet and free from all distractions.

The Goal of Yoga

Patanjali explained that when the mind is
kept very calm and quiet for a long time in
dhyana, we become united with God and
attain salvation. When a person attains
salvation he reaches the goal of Yoga. This
goal is called samadhi or kaivalya.

Requirements for Yoga

Patanjali taught that we must practice Yoga
very diligently and watchfully. Try to keep

an even mind, in success or failure, he said.

He also taught us to live simply and avoid
temptation.

The great sage further advised that we
must cultivate good character traits. Be
friendly, kindand compassionate, he taught.
Be cheerful. Do not look for faults in others
but always try to improve yourself.

Problems on the Path of Yoga

The wise Patanjali was careful to
point out the obstacles that we
may face while following the path
of ¥ oga. He warned us to beware of
ignorance, self importance, anger,
hatred and excessive attachment.
He explained that sickness, lazi-
ness, doubt and lack of concentra-
tion are all hurdles on this path.

The Path of Yoga

To enable us to cultivate the good
qualities, and overcome the
hurdles, Patanjali laid down an
eight-fold path. This unique path
is known as the Ashtanga-Yoga of
Patanjali. A person who follows
this path is called a yogi.

Ashtanga Yoga - The Eight-Fold Path

Ashta means eight and anga means limbs or parts. The eight limbs of Yoga are:

Yama refers to the Great Universal Commandments. Patanjali lists five

yamas: ,
Ahimsa - Non-violence
Satya - Truth ;
Asteya - Non-stealing
Brahmacharya - Self-control
Aparigraha - Unselfishness
. Niyama Niyama refers to personal disciplines. Patanjali lists five of these:
Saucha - Cleanliness
Santosha - Contentment
Tapas - Great effort
Svadhyaya - Self-study
IshvaraPranidhana - Faith in God

3. Asana Asana means posture,such as the ones described in this book.
4, Pranayama

5. Pratyahara

Pranayama means breath control.
Pratyahara meanscontrol ofthe senses (taste, touch, smell, sightand

hearing).
6. Dharana Dharana means concentration.
7. Dhyana Dhyana means meditation,
8. Samadhi arya or kaivalya, is the goal of Yoga where in the yogi unites

By following this eight-fold patha man gets healthof body and control overhis mind. He becomes
wise and compassionate.

For children, however, only the first three steps of Yoga are important: yama, niyama

and asana. These steps prepare a child for the higher steps of Yoga which they can
practice when they are older.

Yama-Ahimsa

Ahimsa is the first of the yamas. Ahimsa
means non-violence. Saintly men have always
preached and practiced non-violence in
thought, word and deed. Lord Buddha was
one of the greatest teachers of non-violence.
He could influence men and even wild beasts
to become harmless and peaceful.

Once Lord Buddha was walking down the
road followed by several disciples. Seeing him,
his jealous cousin Devadatta, unleashed a
drunken elephant hoping that it would
trample the Buddha to death

As the rampaging elephant charged down the
street people ran helter-skelter. The Buddha’s
disciples also begged their master to flee. The
Buddha,however,remained calm and refused
to run away. The enraged elephant was fur-
ther annoyed at seeing the Buddha
unperturbed and came charging straight at

The Buddha calmly raised his hand in a
gesture of non-violence. The angry beast
stopped dead in its tracks! It then humbly
kneeled down before the Buddha.

Such was the power of Lord Buddha’s non-
violence.

Yama-Satya

Satya is the second yama. Satya means
truthful, honest or virtuous. The life of King
Harish-Chandra provides a very good ex-
ample of a man devoted to satya.

One day Sage Vasishtha met his rival, Sage
Vishvamitra. “My disciple, King Harish-
Chandra, is the most truthful man on earth,”
claimed Vasishtha.

“T shall prove that he is not,” retorted
Vishvamitra. Vishvamitra then promptly
went to King Harish-Chandra’s palace. In
the guise of a poor brahmin he approached
theking.. “O most generous King,” he begged,
“grant me two boons.”

“You shall have whatever you want,” said
the large hearted Harish-Chandra.

“First, I want your kingdom and all your
wealth,” demanded the cunning brahmin.

Harish-Chandra was a man of his word. He
willingly parted with everything he had and
left for the forest clad in a single cloth. His
wife and child followed him.

The brahmin was still not satisfied and | f
followed them into the forest. “Harish-
Chandra, now grantme my second wish.”

“Pray, what more can I give you?” in-
quired the noble king.

“One and a half bushels of gold coins,”
demanded the greedy brahmin.

“Give mea month's time andI shall give you
that too,” promised Harish-Chandra.

oval family then proceeded towards

sought work but could find none. They were
forced to beg for a living.

A month passed. The brahmin again ap-
peared before Harish-Chandra, “Fulfill my

| Second boon, O king, or accept that you are
a liar," he said gleefully.

Seeing her husband’s plight, the queen in-
sisted, “Sell me asa slave, my lord, and fulfil
ur promise.” Most reluctantly, Harish-
Chandra agreed. He sold his wife and his son
too, but still couldn’t raise the required gold
coins. He then sold himself and was finally
able to fulfil his promise:to the brahmin.

The queen and the prince had to toil long
hours for a merchant. Still the merchant
remained unsatisfied. Meanwhile, Harish-
Chandra’s master appointed him as an assis-

tant in the crematorium.

Then one fateful day Harish-Chandra’s son
was bitten by a snake and died. The heart-
broken mother carried the dead child to the
crematorium. Harish-Chandra was
shattered to see his wife bearing.the dead
body of their child. Still, he had to do
his duty! “I am sorry, my dear,” he said
tearfully, “I cannot cremate our son unless
you pay the cremation fees required by my
master.

“My lord, I am a penniless slave,” cried his
wife.

In despair the couple decided to kill them-
selves. Harish-Chandramadea pyre of half-
burnt logs. They placed their dead child on
it. Then, seating themselves besides their

child, they set the pyre ablaze.

At that moment Brahma, Indra and several
other gods descended from heaven and
doused the fire. “Harish Chandra,” ex.
claimed the gods, “You have proved beyond
doubt that you are the most honest man on
earth. Your trials are over.”

The gods brought the prince back to life and
blessed the royal couple. Then Vishvamitra
returned the kingdom to the virtuous and
truthful King Harish-Chandra.

Yama-Asteya

Asteyais the third yama. Asteya means non-
stealing. Sage Patanjali taught that torobor
steal is wrong. Even to be envious of what
another ownsisincorrect. The epic Ramayana
provides a good example of aman who devot-
edly practiced the principle of asteya. His
name was Prince Bharata.

Bharata’s father, King Dasaratha, was the
ruler of Ayodhya. Dasaratha had three wives,
The eldest wife, Kausalya, was the mother of
the crown prince Rama. The youngest wife,
Sumitra, had two sons, Lakshmana and
Shatrughana. The middle wife, Kaikeyi, was
the mother of Prince Bharata.

Once while Prince Bharata was away at his
grandfather’s house, his mother, Queen
Kaikeyi, learned that Prince Rama was to
be crowned the king soon. This upset her,
She went to her husband King Dasaratha,
and said, “Grant me the two boons you had
promised me years ago.”

“Certainly, my beloved,” replied the king

“First,” said the ambitious Kaikeyi, “
son Bharata be crowned king, And med
Rama to the forest for fourteen years.” :

King Dasaratha was heart-broken at Kaikevj'
cruel demands. However, he was bound byhis
promise and granted Kaikeyi her boons.

The obedient prince Rama left for the forest
accompanied by his wife, Sita, and brother
Lakshmana. Urgent summons were sent to
Prince Bharata to return. Meanwhile, the
aged King Dasaratha died of grief

As Bharata entered Ayodhya he noticed the
down-cast faces of the people. “Something is
seriously wrong,” he thought to himself as he
rushed to his mother’s chamber. Kaikeyi was
delighted to see her son. “O Bharata,” she
proclaimed, you shall be crowned the king of
Ayodhya! Your father is no more, and I have
had Rama banished to the forest for fourteen
years.”

The good Bharata washorrified athis mother’s
words. “Mother”, he cried, “You are blinded by
greed.! I have no use for power, nor do I wish
to rob my brother, Rama, of his kingdom!”
Bharata immediately left for the forest. “I
must bringmy belovedbrother Rama. back to
rule his kingdom,” he resolved.

IntheChitrakuta forest Bharatametup with
Rama, Sitaand Lakshmana. Fallingat Rama’s
feet, the pure hearted Bharata sobbed, “For-
give me, dear brother. I am innocent. Please
return to govern your land and people. Our

father, the king, is no more.”

Rama knew that Bharata was faultless, but he.
could not be persuaded to come out of exile.

Finally, the wise sage Vashishtha intervened.
He ordained that Bharata should serve as the
king during Rama’s absence.

With a heavy heart Bharata agreed. Before
departing Bharata begged Rama to give him
hissandals. On returning to Ayodhya, Bharata
humbly placed Rama’s sandals on the throne.
Hethen movedtoa hermitage on the outskirts
of Ayodhya. Living thesimplelife ofan ascetic,
he ruled the kingdom from there.

Yama-Brahmacharya

Brahmacharya is the fourth yama.
Brahmacharya means self-control or self-dis-
cipline. A disciplined student who studies
the scriptures is called a brahmachari.

Sage Vyasa's son, Shuka, was a great
brahmachari. As a young boy, Shuka’s fa-
ther sent him tostudy undersage Brihaspati.
Shuka was a keen and intelligent student
and mastered many subjects. When Shuka
returned home he continued to study and

pray.

A few years passed, Sage Vyasa
thought, “Shuka is now a young
man. It is time for him to marry.”
Vyasa proposed that Shuka get
married but he replied, “No, I
want to become a sanyasi and
attain salvation.”

The learned sage Vyasa taught
his son many further philosophi-
cal scriptures. Still, Shuka
' thirsted for knowledge. Vyasa
then advised his son, “Seek out
Janaka, the king of Mithila, and
study under him. He is the
wisest man on earth.”
Shuka set off for the dis-
tant kingdom. He
journeyed over
mountains and
through forests for
two years. Finally,
Shuka arrived at
Janaka's palace:

Through his yogic powers, King Janaka ~
already knew of Shuka's arrival and the
purpose of his visit. He decided to test Shuka,
He instructed the sentries not to honour or
welcome Shuka at the palace gates. Shuka
was made to wait for three days. He waited
patiently, undisturbed by this unkind re-

ception.

On the fourth day Janaka arrived at the

gates, welcomed Shuka and led him to the ©
guestroom. There Shuka was provided with —
every comfort. He was bathed in perfumed _
water, dressed in silken robes and given
delicious food. Shuka showed no greed or —
great delight at these luxuries. Instead, he
spent his days in meditation and prayer.

Because neither insults nor luxuries af-
fected Shuka, King Janaka decided to put
him to one final test. In the splendid court
room, filled with dazzling performers, King
Janaka gave Shuka a bowl full of milk.
“Make seven rounds of this hall without
spilling one drop of milk,” said the King.
Shuka accepted the bowl. He walked effort-
lessly around the great hall seven times,
past the magnificient courtiers, the whirl-
ing dancing girls and the musicians, with-
out spilling a single drop of milk.

King Janaka was delighted. “Shuka,” he
said, “You are unequalled in your self-con-
trol and self-discipline. I have nothing to
teach you. Continue your practices and you
will attain the supreme enlightenment.”

Yama-Aparigraha

Aparigraha is the fifth yama. Aparigraha
means not to grasp or clutch onto things.
One should not be greedy and should learn
tolive with few possessions. Many years ago
in South India there lived a pious brahmin
named Vishnu-dasa. His life providesa good
example of a man who firmly practised
aparigraha.

Vishnu-dasa lived during the reign of the
devout King Chola of Kanchi. King Chola
prided himself on his piety. He offered fresh
flowers and pearls to the gods in his daily
worship.

Oneday while the king was offeringhis prayers,
thesimple Vishnu-dasa arrived at the temple.
Unmindful of the king, he sat down to pray.
During his worship, Vishnu-dasa offered the
gods a few holy basil leaves and some clear,
fresh water from an earthen pot.

Seeing this the proud king was offended.
‘You poor brahmin, how dare you offer the
Lordsuch meagre offerings? You shall never
attain the kingdom of heaven.”

‘Let us see who attains the kingdom of the
gods first ,” replied Vishnu-dasa.

On returning to his palace, the king called
his minister and asked, “What shall I do to
please the gods?”

“Why not make a grand charitable home for
the needy and the poor, your Honour?”
‘That’s an excellent idea. Let the work com-
mence immediately commanded the' king ”
The pious Vishnu-dasa meanwhile contin-
ued to live an austere life devoted to prayer

and worship. He lived si 1
one meal a day. acne.

One day after completing his prayers, the
poor brahmin, Vishnu-dasa, cooked his food
and left it to cool on the window. He then
went out fora short walk. When he returned
he found that someone had eaten his food.
The next day the same thing happened. The
thefts continued daily. Deprived of his daily
meal Vishnu-dasa thought, “Perhaps the
gods want me to fast.”

A few days later, while Vishnu-dasa was
walking around as his food cooled, he no-
ticed a ragged beggar creeping up to the
window. As Vishnu dasa watched unob-
served, he saw a hungry wretch stuffing
food into his mouth and then sneaking away.
Vishnu-dasa felt very sorry for the starved
beggar. Noticing that the beggar had left
the butter uneaten, Vishnu-dasa ran after
him, “Please wait,” shouted Vishnu-dasa,
“you have forgotten to eat the butter!” But
the beggarran faster, thinking that Vishnu-
dasa wanted to beat him.

At last, Vishnu-dasa caught up with the
beggar. “Do eat the butter, too,” pleaded the
selfless brahmin. The beggar was aston-
ished to see the thin and frail brahmin
parting happily with his food.

In an instant, the beggar changed into his
true form. He was none other than the great
Lord Vishnu! “My dear devotee, your selfless-
nessisunmatched onearth,” said Lord Vishnu.
The Lord then took Vishnu-dasa to heaven.

Niyama-Saucha

Sauchais the firstofthe niyamas. Saucha means
purity orcleanliness.Pure thoughts, good feelings
and the cleanliness of the body are all aspects of
saucha. While bathing and personal hygiene
constitute external cleanliness, the practice of
asanas and pranayama helps us cleanse our
organs of toxins and impurities and our minds
of impure thoughts. Yogis and devout people
always purified themselves before commenc-
ing their prayers and daily activities.

A long time ago there lived a powerful king in
Kashmir. Unfortunately, he contracted leprosy.
Physicians and healers were called from far and
widetocuretheking, butnoneofthemsucceeded.

The king then decided to go on a pilgrimage. He
journeyed far and wide and met many holy men
and sages, but none could help him. At long
last he arrived at the temple town of Chidam-
baram. To purify himself before entering the
shrine the king took a dip in the temple tank.

} When he stepped out of the water, the king

noticed that his body had been cleansed of the
dreaded disease. His deformities were removed
and his whole body sparkled with health and
vigour.

The king’s joy knew no bounds. Pure in body and
mind he offered his thanks to Lord Shiva in the
ancient temple. He then made a generous grant
whereby the ancient temple was enlarged and
made more glorious.

Niyama-Santosha

Santoshaisthesecondniyama. Santoshameans
satisfactionor contentment. Thestory ofKrishna
and his childhood friend Sudama teaches us the
meaning of santosha or contentment.

When Krishna wasa young boy he studied at the
ashram of Guru Sandipani. Krishna's best friend
at the ashram was a clever brahmin boy named
Sudama. The two boys studied, played and grew
up together at the ashram.

On completing their studies the boys were sad to
part. After leaving the ashram Krishna had
many adventures. He eventually became the
king of Dwaraka. Sudama chose to become a
priest.

In time, Sudama married a devout lady named
Sushila. Over the years Sudama’s family grew
but his earnings as a priest remained meagre.
Sushila foundit very difficult tomake ends meet.
One day there was no food in the house. In
despair, Sushila turned to her husband.

a

Sudama's heart lit up at the thought of seeing
his beloved friend. "I would love to see Krishna
he said, "but I shall not beg money from him."

: Sushila was very happy. She borrowed some
_ puffed rice from a neighbour and tied it into a
ee bundle. "Take this gift for your friend," she
sai

Bearing the humble gift, Sudama set off for
distant Dwaraka. After a long walk he arrived
at Krishna’s capital. The grandeur of the city
overwhelmed him. Meekly, he walked up to
the palace gates.

Asentry barred his way. “Whoare youand what
do you want?"

"I am Sudama." I have come to see my friend,

b The guard couldn't believe that this poor man
could be the king's friend. Reluctantly, he con-
veyed the message to the king.

i was overjoyed to hear that Sudama had
a see hiva. He rushed to the palace eaten
to greet his dear friend. Embracing the “a
Sudama, Krishna took him into the palace. :
king himself washed Sudamas feet and saw

all his comforts.

Suddenly Krishna noticed the cloth bundle that

Sudama had brought. "What is in that?" he
asked.

Sudama felt ashamed to offer the king his
modest present, but Krishna grabbed it from
him and eagerly opened it. “Puffed rice,” he

‘said, “my favourite!” and began to eat hand-

fuls of this simple fare.

Sudama was pleased to see that his friend, the
king, wassatisfied with hishumblegift. Thetwo
friends talked for hours. At Krishna's request
Sudama spenta few days at the palace. Finally,
remembering that his family would be waiting
for him, Sudama took his leave.

While returning in the royal chariot, Sudama
remembered the purpose for which Sushila had
sent him. "Krishna did not even ask me about
my needs," he thought, "how can Lreturn to my
family empty handed?”

Downcast, Sudama got off the chariot a short

distance from his hut. Sadly, he walked home-

wards. Strangely, alarge mansion stood where

his little hut had been. Sudama was worried.

“Where is my little house?” he thought, “and
where is my family?”

Just then Sushila opened the door. She was
dressed in fine clothes and attended by many
servants. "Welcome my Lord!" she greeted her
husband joyously. "King Krishna arranged all
this while you were away."

The pious Sudama’s trials were over. He how-

Niyama-Tapas

Tapas is the third niyama. Tapas means
penance, austerity or a burning effort.

The boy Dhruva is remembered for the
difficult penance he practised.

Dhruva's father, the mighty king
Uttanapada, had two wives. The elder wife,
Suniti was kind and miodest. Her son was
Dhruva. The younger wife, Surichi was
haughty and ambitious. She was the mother
of Uttama.

Surichi was the king's favourite, She wished
to ensure that her son would be the king's
successor. She therefore, took every oppor-
tunity to belittle the elder queen and her
innocent son Dhruva. The king believed
Surichi's tales and showered all his affec-
tion on the younger queen and her son.

One day little Dhruva, finding his father
alone, went and sat on his lap. At that
moment Surichi arrived, "How dare you sit
on the king's lap?” she screamed and pulled
Dhruva out of his father's lap.

Dhruva was hurt and went crying to his
mother. "Mother," he vowed, "I shall prac-
tice penance and attain a position higher
than that of my father, the king!"

Suniti tried to dissuade her son, but the
strong-willed boy held steadfastly to his
vow. Finally, Dhruva obtained his mother’s
blessings and left for the forest

Although he was only a boy, Dhruva wan-
dered alone in the forest in search of a
teacher. Whenever Dhruva met wise and
holy men he asked them, "Please, can you
show me the path to heaven?"

Some wisemen admired his courage, others
laughed at him, and others asked him to
return home. None, however, could show
him the path sought.

vering Dhruva continued his
search. He lived on wild fruits, berries and
water. Neither heat nor cold, neither wild
beasts nor hunger could deter him from his
efforts. Then one day Dhruva met the
wise sage, Narada. Narada taught Dhruva
a prayer. "Ifyou wish to reach heaven, said
Narada, "chant this prayer and meditate on
the Lord."

Dhruva was happy for the guidance. He sat
cross-legged under a tree and concentrated
his thoughts and feelings ‘on Lord Vishnu.
For days on end he mediated, prayed and
fasted.

Greatly impressed by the child's burning
efforts and austerities, Lord Vishnu ap-
peared before him.

“O Lord,” the boy prayed, “please remove
all my mother’s sorrows and grant me a
place in heaven.”

"Dhruva", said Lord Vishnu. "Your penance
has been more severe than that of great

sages. I shall grant your wish. Now, return
home to your mother."

Young Dhruva returned home with a large
following. His parents were delighted to see
him. Surichi apologised for having mis-
treated him.

When Dhruva came of age, King
Uttanapada crowned him king. Dhruva
wisely governed his kingdom for many years.
When he grew old Vishnu raised him to the

heavens and made him a bright star called
Dhruva, the. pole star.

Niyama-Svadhyaya

Svadhyayais the fourth niyama. Svadhyaya
means self-study or to know one's self. In
the Upanishads there is astory of young boy
named Nachiketa. Nachiketa provides a
good example of somebody who really
wanted to know and understand himself.

Nachiketa's father, sage Vajashravasa, once
conducted a great ceremony. In the hope
that he would reach heaven he gave many
cows for alms. However, these cows were
lean and old. Nachiketa was saddened to
see his father’s lack of generosity.

Toreprimandhis father the little boy asked,
"Who will you give me to, father?"

At first Vajashravasa did not reply.
Nachiketa persisted with his question. An-
noyed, his father muttered, "I give you to
the God of Death."

Undaunted, Nachiketa marched off to the
palace of Yama, the God of Death. Yama
was away and so Nachiketa waited, fasting

‘,

and praying in the meanwhile. Three days
later, when Yama returned, he found a
fearless boy standing at the palace gates.
The God of Death was pleased with the lad's
devotion anddetermination. "Since you have
waited for three days I shall grant you three
boons," he said to Nachiketa.

“Then let my father be happy when I return
to him on earth." requested Nachiketa.

"Granted," answered Yama.

“Now tell me how to get to heaven?" asked
Nachiketa.

Yama then taught Nachiketa how to attain
the sorrowless world called heaven.

"Andlastly," demanded Nachiketa, "explain
to me what happens toa man after he dies."

“That is a very difficult question,” said
Yama, taken aback. "Ask for anything else,
herds of cattle, many elephants, gold, pal-
aces, a long life.

"Oh no, I don't want any of these things,"
insisted Nachiketa. "Tell me, does a man
continue to exist after he dies?"

Convinced of Nachiketa's keen desire to
understand the mysteries of life and death,
Yama relented.

“The soul continues to exist though the
body dies and decays," explained Yama.

"The soul is like a rider," continued Yama,

“and your body is like a chariot. Your intel-
ligence is the charioteer and your thoughts
and feeling are the reins. Your five senses,
sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch are
the five horses that draw the chariot. The
world around you is like the pastures on
which these horses graze.”

Then Yama taught Nachiketa the impor-
tance of yoga. He explained, “By practicing
Yoga, Nachiketa, you can bring your senses
under control just as a charioteer brings his
horses under control. As soon as you have
controlled your senses, you will see the soul
and understand yourself."

Nachiketa learned well what Yama taught.
He made a deep effort to understand his
true nature and thereby became a wise and
perfect man.

Niyama-Ishvara Pranidhana

Ishvara pranidhana is the last niyama.
Ishvara pranidhana means faith in God.
There is an amazing story of a boy named
Prahlada who, though born of demon par-
ents, had tremendous faith in God.

King Hiranya-kashyapu, who controlled a
vast empire, was a powerful demon. He
hated Lord Vishnu because Vishnu had
killed his twin brother. One day he sum-
moned his ministers and said, “Destroy
all temples and images of Vishnu in my
kingdom. Burn all books bearing
Vishnu’s name and make sure that no
one chants his name in my domain!”

The king wished to ensure that his little
boy, Prahlada, would grow up to be a fierce
demon. Therefore, he entrusted Prahlada
to a renowned teacher saying, “Initiate the
boy into all the demonic ways, teach him
to despise the gods and make sure he never
hears the name of Vishnu.”

Several months later, keen to know how his
son had fared in his studies, the king sent
for Prahlada, “Boy, what have you learned
so far?"

“I have learned to adore the name of
Vishnu,” said the innocent child.

"What!" cried Hiranya-kashyapu, hardly
able to believe his ears. “Call the boy's
teacher and chop off his head!"

Trembling, the teacher arrived, “Pardon
26 / Yoga for Children

me, my Lord, I did not teach Prahlada to adore

Vishnu.”

“Then who taught you that dreadful name?”

thundered Hiranya:-kashyapu.

“Lord Vishnu himself taught me,” replied

the devout Prahlada.

“Take this boy away,” fumed the king, “and
rid him of this nonsense which he has

learned.”

Disillusioned, the king left Prahlada to his
studies for a few more years. Then he once
again summoned the boy.

"Now have you learned anything sensible?"
he questioned his son.

“I bow to the great Lord Vishnu, began the
pious boy.

Furious, the king ordered his demon sol-
diers to kill the boy. The soldiers attacked
Prahlada with sharp-edged swords and
heavy clubs. Prahlada stood calmly chant-
ing the name of Lord Vishnu, and with the
Lord's protection remained uninjured by
the blows.

The enraged king then ordered his soldiers
to throw Prahlada into a pit full of poison-
oussnakes. Prahlada stood fearlessly amidst
the serpents, and chanting Lord Vishnu’s
name remained unharmed.

“Throw Prahlada into the fire, “commanded
the infuriated king. But the devout Prahlada
came out of the fire unscathed.

"Drown the boy in the ocean," ordered the
wicked king. However, Lord Vishnu also
protected Prahlada from drowning.

"Hurl Prahlada off a high cliff," said the
cruel king. Even while Prahlada fell he
continued mediating on Lord Vishnu. He
landed gently on the ground and was unhurt.
Prahlada then returned to his father’s
palace and continued his life of prayer
and meditation.

One day as:the faithful boy chanted his
prayers, Hiranya-kashyapu challenged him
"Since you say Vishnu is everywhere, show
him to me in this pillar!"

With a terrible roar Lord Vishnu burst out
of the pillar in the form of a half-man-half-
lion. He killed the tyrannical king and
blessed his little devotee.

The pious Prahlada was then crowned king.

Asana

Asana is the third stage of Ashtanga-
Yoga. Asana means a posture or a stance.

Legends say that asanas originated from
Lord Shiva.

Lord Shiva assumed different stances or
asanas to create the different forms of life.
Kach time he performed an asana a new
creature was born. As he did 84,000,000
asanas, 84,000,000 living species came
into being. Yogis, however, know and prac-
tice only a few of these asanas.

pet peregttte tas

While many asanas represent living
things such as a tree, a fish or a crane,
asanas have also been derived from
other sources. A few asanas are derived
from natural forms such as a mountain
or the moon. Some asanas resemble
man-made objects like a boat ora plough.
Still others are dedicated to sages or the
gods. Geometrical shapes have also in-
spired asanas, for example, the triangle-
pose. The names of some other asanas
refer to parts of the body.

Sage Patanjali taught that you should
be firm and steady while performing an
asana. Correct practice, he said, should
lead to a feeling of well-being.

Asanas are scientific exercises. They
not only make us strong and supple, but
they alsohelp toremove impurities from
our bodies. By practicing asanas, the
circulation, respiration, digestion and
elimination are all improved. Asanas
also improve the memory, concentra-
tion and will-power. They teach us how
to be calm.Asanas are thus invaluable
for the health of body and mind.

Yoga for Children | 27

Pranayama

Pranayama is the fourth stage of’ Yoga.
Pranayama means breath control. There are
three important movements in pranayama
inhalation of the breath, exhalation of the
breath and retention of the breath.

There is an interesting story in the
Upanishads which shows the importance of
the breath.

Once there was a dispute between the eyes,
the ears, the speech, the mind and the breath
as to who was the most important. They all
approached Lord Brahma and asked him,
“Pray tell us, who is the greatest amongst us?”

“That’s easy,” Brahma said. “Each of you will
leave the body for a year. The body will then
decide who amongst you is the greatest.”

Following Brahma’s advice, first the tongue
went off leaving the body without speech for
a whole year. When the tongue came back the
eyes wentoff leaving the body blind fora year.
When the eyes returned, the ears went off
leaving the body deaf for a year. When the
ears returned, the mind went off and the body
remained like a simpleton for a whole year.
“Then the mind returned.

Nextit was the breaths turn to leave the body.
As soon as the breath began to depart the
tongue lost its power of speech, the eyes lost
their power tosee, the ears lost their ability to
hear and the mind lost its intelligence! “Come_
back, come back, O breath,” they prayed, “for
you are the greatest amongst us!”

The breath then returned and the body
became whole again.

Pratyahara

Pratyahara is the fifth stage of Ashtanga
Yoga. Prayahara means to restrain or to
withdraw. In pratyahara the yogi remains
quiet. He does not get distracted or dis-
turbed by things which he sees, hears, smells
tastes or feels.

The great sage Chayavana provides a per-
fect example of someone who practised
pratyahara. In his youth Chayavana re-
tired-to a peaceful place in the forest.

He sat down, closed his eyes and fixed his
mind on God. Many days, weeks and sea-
sons passed, but Chayavana did not feel or
notice anything. He remained still and quiet.
Years went by, white ants made a big mound
over him. Plants and creepers covered the
ant hill. Birds and little creatures made
their homes amongst the vegetation and
still Chayavana remained unmoving,
unmindful of the changes around him.

Dharana

Dharana is the sixth stage of Ashtanga
Yoga. Dharana means keeping the mind
steady and concentrated. Arjuna’s reply to
his guru Drona’s question provides a fine
example of dharana.

Once Guru Drona was instructing his pu-
pils, the young Kaurava and Pandava
princes, in the science of archery. For a
target Drona placed a wooden bird on the
branch of a distant tree. He then asked his
pupils to come forward one by one to test
their skill and concentration. First he called

Yudhisthira.

“What do yousee?” Drona asked, pointing to
the target.

“Sir,” replied Yudhisthira, “I see the blue
sky, a tree, branches, leaves and a bird
sitting amongst them.”

“Go back and sit down,” snapped Drona
annoyed at this answer. “There is no way
that you will be able to hit the target."

Then Drona called the other princes one by
one, “What do yousee there?” he asked each
of them. The replies were similar to
Yudhisthira’s. “You are all unfit even to
attempt to shoot this target,” he said,

Finally, it was Arjuna’s turn. “Well, what
do you see there, Arjuna?” Drona addressed
his favourite student.

Arjuna looked intently at the target. “Sir,’
he said, “I see only the right eye of a bird.”

Drona was pleased. “Good,” he said, “now
you must try and shoot the bird’s eye.”

Arjuna concentrated his mind on the target,
took careful aim and lo! he pierced the
bird’s eye with his first arrow.

Delighted, Drona hugged his keen and
attentive pupil.

| Dhyana,

Dhyana is the seventh stage of Ashtanga
Yoga. Dhyana means meditation,
contemplation or reflection on God. The
hermit Valmiki provides a good example
of someone deeply absorbed in meditation.

Strangely, Valmiki was a bandit in his
early life. One day he came upon the seven
wise sages journeying through the forest.
‘Valmiki demanded that they hand him any
valuable they had.

The wise sages suggested that, Valmiki
meet his family and ask them whether they
would share his sins as they shared his
plundered wealth. Valmiki ran to his family

and put this question to them He was hor-
rified when his wife and children refused to
share the responsibility for his misdeeds.

Valmiki rushed back to the wise sages and
sought their forgiveness. "Show me the
path whereby I can become a good man," he
begged.

The sages then asked him to chant "Mara,"
the name of the God of Death.

Immediately the robber sat down under
tree and began to chant "Ma-ra, Ma-ra, Ma-
ra." He chanted for a long time and gradu-
ally, as the rogue became purer his chant
changed from "Ma-ra, Ma-ra, Ma-ra to Ra-

continuously chanted Lord Rama's name.

White ants covered the meditating hermit j

Many years later the seven sages again =
passed through the same forest. Thy heard —

from an ant hill. When the sages broke the ©
and hill they discovered Valmiki immersed —
in meditation. Asthey foundhim inamound

Years later the wise sage Valmiki composed.
the great Ramayana.

Samadhi

Samadhi is the eighth and final stage of
Ashtanga Yoga. In samadhi the mind is
concentrated perfectly on God for a long
time. The yogi then has a vision of God and
becomes a wise and holy sage. Sage Kapila
was a master of Yoga and showed several
keen disciples the way to God.

When Kapila’s father died, his mother,
Devahuti, sought her son's guidance on the
path of Yoga. Kapila knew that his mother

was a devout and pious lady ready to
receive the highest knowledge. So he
taught her the advanced aspects of Yoga.

Devahuti then retired to the forest clad in
garments made of bark. There she prayed
and fasted. One day, while she sat in deep
meditation on the banks of the river
Sarasvati, Devahuti attained the goal of
Yoga, samadhi! She then became one with
God.

The Standing Poses

A long, long time ago there lived a great sage
named Daksha. One of Daksha’s. daughters,
Sati, had set her heart on Lord Shiva.
Unwillingly, Daksha consented to their
marriage. However, when Daksha conducted a
great religious ceremony he did not invite Shiva.
Sati attended the ceremony even thoughshe was -a<
not invited. EU)
“Why have you not invited my husband, the 7

great Lord Shiva?” she asked her father.

“Your husband is a madman,” mocked Daksha.
“He wears snakes and annoints himself with
ashes.”

Unable to bear the humiliation, Sati died.
\ Hearing of Sati’s death, Shiva was furious. He
\ plucked out one of his matted locks and dashed
* itto the ground. Ofthis lock was born a ferocious
warrior, Virabhadra! Shiva appointed
Virabhadra the commander of his army and
instructed him to destroy Daksha’s great
ceremony.

Daksha’s daughters.

One day the daughters complained to their fa-
ther, “Our husband loves only our sister, Rohini.
He neglects the rest of us.”

In a fit of rage Daksha cursed the moon:
“Chandra,” said Daksha, “you will fade away and
die.”

Horrified, Chandra’s
wives begged their
father to withdraw
such a terrible curse.
It was not possible to
withdraw the curse.
Daksha, however,
agreed to change it.
“Chandra, you will
henceforth fade for a
fortnight and grow for
a fortnight.”

That is why the moon
continuously waxes
and wanes.

Lord Surya, the sun,is considered the source of
light, heat and knowledge. He rides across the
sky in a chariot pulled by seven shining horses.

The yogis, too, invoke the blessings of the sun. To
do this they perform a sequence of bending and

performed in quick succession, often jumping
from pose to pose. The entire sequence is re-

it ri told that after winning the great battle, the

old age approaching, they handed the kingdom to
their successors. Then the brothers and their
wife Draupadi set out for the high Himalayas. A
lean and hungry dog joined them on the way.
First Draupadi collapsed of exhaution. Then four
of the Pandava brothers also fell along the way.
Only the eldest brother, the virtuous Yudhishthira
accompanied by the faithful dog, reached the
high Himalayas.

Lord Indra arrived in his chariot and invited
Yudhishthira to heaven. Seeing his faithful dog

wagging its tail, Yudhishthira stepped aside to

let it enter the chariot first. “This dirty dog
cannot come to heaven”, shouted Indra

“He.is my loyal companion,” said Yudhishthira.

“If he may not join me then I, too, shall not come

to heaven."

Delighted at hearing these
words, the dog assumedits true
form. The dog was none other
than Yama, the god of justice.
Yama had put Yudhishthira to
one last test.

Indra then took Yudhishthira
to heaven.

The Inverted Poses

Lord Rama sent the monkey god,.Hanuman, on
a mission to locate his wife Sita. Hanuman re-
turned to the mainland and reported ;‘Sita is the
captive of Ravana, the King of Lanka.” Rama
raised a large army of bears and monkeys andset
out to rescue her. The army arrived at the sea

shore quickly.

Rama was troubled. “How; he thought, “will this
large army cross the ocean and reach Lanka?” In
order to woo Varuna, the Lord of the ocean, Rama
began fasting on the seashore. But even after
three days Varuna did not come out to help them.

Mf ;
“

Setu Bandha Sarvanga-asana—The Bridge Pose

58 | Yoga for Children

Enraged at Varuna’s pride, Rama unleashed a
fiery arrow deep into the waters. Varuna hastily
appeared and bowed before Lord Rama with
folded palms: “I will guide your army where to
build a bridge. I shall also bear the boulders and
trees your soldiers throw into the waters so that
your bridge may be firm.” Varuna then returned
to. the depths of ocean.

The bears and monkeys set to work without
delay. Jambavan,the king of the bears, Sugriva,
the king of the monkeys, and Nalaand Hanuman,

Sugriva’s ministers spurred them on. They
dug up great boulders and hurled them
into the ocean, “Splash!”Great trees were
uprooted and dropped in. The top of the
path was made smooth with mud and
small pieces of wood. Speedily, the sea was
bridged. Rama’s army swiftly crossed the

ocean to wage war against Ravana, the

wicked king of Lanka.

Ever since those days this “bridge” has
been called Setu Bandha.

The Cross -Legged Poses

There once lived a wise king named Manu. One
day while Manu was bathing in the river, a little
fish sought shelter in his cupped palnis. “Save
me,” it said, “and some day I shall help you.”

Amazed, Manu placed the fish in a pot of water.
Overnight the fish outgrew the pot. So Manu
placed it in a well. Very shortly it grew too large
to live in the well. Astonished, Manu placed this
magic fish in a large lake. Sure enough, it soon
outgrew the lake. So Manu led it the river,
Ganga. The fish continued to grow. Manu now
realised that this fish could be none other than
the great Lord Vishnu. Reverentially, he took it

to the ocean. ——

Pleased with Manu’s dedication and devotion,

the fish confirmed that it was, indeed, a form of
Lord Vishnu. It warned Manu of an approaching

flood which would drown the whole earth. It

instructed him to build a ship, and to load it with

the eggs and the young of plants, insects, birds,

mammals and all other living creatures. Manu
wisely followed the divine counsel.

The Forward Bending Poses

The gods were constantly losing battles against
the demons. Worried, they sought Lord Vishnu’s
aid.

“Go and befriend the demons,” advised Vishnu.
“Take their help and churn the ocean for amrit,
the nectar ofimmortality. Drink this nectar and
you will become invincible.”

The gods followed Vishnu’s advice. The great moun-
tain, Mandara, was uprooted and used as a churn-
ing rod. Vasuki, the serpent king, served as a rope.

76 / Yoga for Children

N wil Mz,

The demons pulled Vasuki’s head while the gods
tugged at his tail. The churning of the ocean com-
menced.

Unexpectedly Mount Mandara began sinking. It
had no foundation. Seeing the danger, Lord Vishnu
becamea giant tortoise. The tortoise dived deep into
the ocean and supported the mountain on its back.

The churning continued in earnest. The heat
and friction led to great destruction. Huge trees
on Mandara were uprooted. Animals and birds
fled their forest homes. Fires ravaged the great
mountain. Vasuki, too, bellowed poisonous
fumes. The gods and the demons were at their
wits’ end and prayed to Vishnu for strength to
carry on.

With: Vishnu’s blessings they resumed the churn-
ing. At last, the ocean yielded many wonderful gifts:
the miraculous cow, Surubhi, and the magic wish
fullfilling tree, KalpaVriksha, Vishnu’sconch shell,
Shankha‘andhis fabulous jewel, KaustabhaThen,
Vishnu’s wife, the beautiful goddess Lakshmi arose
from the waters clad in shining white. Soma, the
silvery moon, too emerged from the ocean. Lord
Shiva took it to adorn his forehead.

Suddenly.acloudof poison arose andendangeredall
creation. Quickly, Shiva drank the poison but
confined it to his throat, which turned blue. Lord
Indra’s wonderful white horse and his great, four-
tusked elephant were also born from,the churning
waters.

Finally, Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods,
appeared. He carried a white pitcher which con-
tained thenectar ofimmortality. The demons seized
the nectar. Realising the danger, Vishnu changed
himselfintoa beautifuldamselnamed Mobini:She
bewitched the demons, took away the nectar and
gave it to the gods.

Brahma, the creator, needed help in creating the
universe. So by the power of his thought he
created ten sages. Marichi was one of these great
sages. These great sages made thirteen offerings
to the fire-god. From these offerings men, horses,
cows, sheep, barley, the rainy season and many
other things were created.

The Twisting Poses

When the Earth was young there lived a good and
wise sage named Bharadvaja.. He spent most ofhis
days studying the Vedic scriptures. His thirst for
learning knew no bounds. He soon realised that
the great scriptures could not be mastered in one
lifetime.

Bharadvaja decided to invoke Lord Indra’s bless-
ings for a long life. In a quiet place in the forest
he practised severe penance for many years.
“Grant me, O Lord,” he pleaded, “ a lifetime of
many thousands.of years so that I may study the
Vedas.” Pleased, Lord Indra granted him his
wish,

With one pointed attention Bharadvaja contin-
ued his study of the Vedas. Thousands of years
went by but his studies remained incomplete.
Realising that this long life-was coming to an end
Bharadvaja again prayed to Indra. “O Lord,” he
beseeched, “I need several thousand years more
to complete my task.”

Lord Indra appeared before his devotee. He.took
him before three mountains. Then picking up
three handfuls of sand Indra gave them to
Bharadvaja. “What you have learned so far only

amounts to these three handfuls of sand,” said S\

Indra. “The Vedas yet to be studied are equal to
these three mountains.”

Bharadvaja was not to be discouraged. He ac-
cepted the challenge and continued his studies
undaunted.

Fourteen years later Lord Rama and his compan-

Bharadvaja cast a magic spell. He made every tree

They requested the mighty eagle, Garuda, to

strength, the proud Garuda set off.

On finding the great snake, Garuda said, “O
Vasuki, the gods-require your service urgently!”

“T will be happy to help the gods,” replied Vasuki,
“but you will have to carry me to the seashore.”

Garuda promptly grabbed the snake’s middle in
his huge claws and flew off. He ascended higher
and higher till he reached the heavens. Looking

down, Garuda was astonished. Vasuki’s head |

and coiled tail were still on the ground far below!
Humbled,Garuda returned to the gods.

Then Lord Shiva lowered his arm. Vasuki coiled
himself into a bracelet on Shiva’s wrist. Lord
Shiva then took Vasuki to the seashore.

hoping to win fair Draupadi’s hand. Amongst these

these princes were in exile, they came in disguise.

On the day of the contest all the suitors as-

10 to 15 counts

Kapota means a dove or pigeon. King Shibi
was a good and just ruler. He cared for all
of his subjects and was kind to animals, too. His
fame spread on earth and in heaven.

One day, a dove, which was fleeing from a hawk,
took shelter on King Shibi’s lap. “Don’t worry,
little dove,” assured the gentle king, “you are safe
with me.”

Angrily, the hawk swooped down. “Give me the
dove,” it demanded. “I am hungry! By protecting
the dove you are being unjust to me.”

I shall give you the meat of a deer or a boar
instead,” said King Shibi.

“I don’t eat deer or boar,” replied the hawk. “The
dove is my natural prey.”

"Please spare this dove,” begged the King. “You
can ask for anything else you wish.”

“Flesh from your body equal to the weight of the
dove is the only other food which I shall accept!”

King Shibi did not hesitate. He sent for a pair of
scales anda knife. He placed the dove on one pan of
the scale and on the other pan he placed chunks of
his own flesh. Though he carved out many pieces of
flesh from his legs andarms, still the dove remained
heavier. Then, seeing no other option, King Shibi
stepped onto the scales.

“Eat me,” said the King to the hawk.

When Bhishma fell under Arjuna’s shower of
arrows, his body did not hit the ground. It re-

Bhishma did not die: He even refused to be
removed from the battlefield and to have his
wounds tended. “A bed of arrows befits a dying
warrior,” he remarked.

The furious battle raged on. However, around
Bhishma’s bed there was calm. The Kaurava and
the Pandava princes, great kings and noblemen
came to his side. They begged his forgiveness and
sought his advice on state-craft and right con-

While sitting thus in the shade of a large tree,

“I have come to take Satyavan’s soul to the land of

Satyavan’s soul in his noose and began to walk

The courageous Savitri left Satyavan’s dead body

136 / Yoga for Children

A Note to the Reader

This manual has been written to complement
Yoga for Children. We hope that it will be
useful to teachers and parents in guiding,
motivating and assisting their children to
practice Yoga.

Classical Sanskrit words, including names of
asanas, have been broken down into simpler
forms which make for easy reading and
pronunciation. Diacritical marks have not
been used as children find these difficult to
understand.

\

1. Stretch Like a Dog

Stretch like a dog, bend your legs like a
frog...sit straight as a rod...lunge like a
crocodile...be tall as a mountain... with-
draw your limbslike asleeping turtle...don't
be like a sunken boat...

We found ourselves using many such meta-
phors while exhorting children to attain or
improve a pose during a Yoga class. It was
from these metaphors that this book was
conceived. Yoga for children is certainly
one way to ensure that our children grow up
healthy and happy.

Of the many aspects of Yoga, yama, niyama
and asana are relevant for children. While
the principles yama and niyama reinforce
the universal values such as truth,
non-violence, cleanliness and contentment,
the asanas help a growing child develop
physically, emotionally and psychologically.
In this way Yoga is a necessary complement
to formal education. By practicing this won-
derful science and art children can blossom
into healthy,and well balanced men and
women with strong bodies, clear minds’
and pure hearts.

In this endeavor the role of the Yoga teacher
is crucial. The teacher must understand the
nature of children and be sensitive to the
moods and needs of the growing child.-Chil-
dren are creative by nature. They are ex-
pressive, outgoing and exuberant. They are
courageous and curious and also sincere
and devout. They are positive in nature.
They are quick and agile and love variety
and novelty.

Yoga-asanas are well suited for children.
They are imaginative and unique. Asanas
can be demonstrated, imitated and adapted.
The asanas are dynamic, intense and chal-
lenging. They help a child to develop will-
power, and sensitivity and provide children
a means to learn about themselves through
a wide range of body movements.

Yoga for Children / 137

Childhood is a process of
change, from fragility to
strength, from immaturity to
maturity, from simplicity to
complexity. Accordingly, the
approach for the 'six year old,
the ten year old and the sixteen
year old must vary greatly.

Little children should begin to
learn the asanas playfully. They
lack muscular strength and they
must not be forced. They love
animals and nature and also the
poses inspired by these.

Ten year old children are co-
operative and delight in Yoga.
They are agile but no longer so
fragile. They love to try out a

wide range of movements.

Pubescent children pose a
challenge to the teacher. They

138 / Yoga for Children

are in a state of physical upheaval and
psychological turmoil. The Yoga teacher should
teach them the asanas which help them to overcome
their awkwardness and gain equilibrium.

Adolescents aged sixteen to eighteen are stronger,
more energetic and can grasp some of the nuances
in the asanas. They can be taught more tech-
niques and the teacher must demand more preci-
sion from them. For these teen-agers both the
intensity and the duration of the asanas can be
increased.

Despite these differences all children have many
things in common. They love dynamic movements
with quick changes. Speed and variety are essen-
tial to keep their interest in the Yoga-asanas.,
They love expressive and outgoing asanas like the
backward-bending poses and the head-stand.
Though children are courageous they are not

foolhardy. They are also physically and emotion-
ally resilient.

Yoga teachers should avoid teaching children the

advanced or esoteric aspects of Yoga such as
meditation, pranayama, bandhas and shatkriyas
These practices are contrary to the nature of
children. While Yoga theory can and should be
introduced to older children, it should be second-
ary, to the practice of asanas and should be taught
as‘informally as possible.

The most suitable place to introduce Yoga to
children is in schools. A teacher would be well
advised to group children of approximately the

such easy movements. They realize that though

A Yoga teacher must, therefore, have physical
agility and mental sharpness. The teacher should
be a keen practitioner of Yoga. He should be able to
do the asanas along with the children and not just
make demands of them and command them to do
the poses. The teacher’s subjective involvement is
essential as children primarily learn by seeing and

are very courageous.

3. Little Children
By Geeta Iyengar

Teachers and parents are often uncertain about
the age at which children should commence
Yoga practice. Children aged eight years and
above are fit to practice Yoga. Children between
the ages of five and eight can also do some
asanas. However, they are too young to practice
Yoga formally. While the static poses do not suit
these children, they don’t have the capacity to do
many dynamic movements either. Itis true that
these little children are very supple and elastic.
However, at this tender age their suppleness,
vibrancy and elasticity should not be taxed.
Little children lack muscular strength. Fur-
thermore, a Yoga class of 20 or 25 minutes
duration becomes too long for them. Little chil-
dren should be permitted to playfully and casu-
ally learn a few postures. It would be a mis-
guided effort to make Yoga compulsory for them.
Little children should be permitted to grow up
naturally. The discipline should not be imposed
too early.

4. Adolescents

Adolescence is the stage between childhood and
maturity roughly letween the ages twelve and
twenty. During this period, around the age of
fourteen, a child reaches puberty, reproductive
capability. Remarkable biological changes occur
in spurts, often outstripping psychological
growth. In particular, the endocrinal glands
undergo important changes and their enhanced
functioning stimulates new patterns of growth
and evolution. Yoga helps a child to ride the tide
of advancing puberty and thereafter to direct
and channel the energy of youth.

The Physiological Importance of Yoga-
asanas for Adolescents

The important physiological and physical ben-
efits of the Yoga-asanas are that they:

* Improve circulation vital to the
proper functioning of the body.

* Nourish, stimulate and
maintain the vital balance of
the endocrinal glands which
govern growth and devel-
opment.

* Help establish
a regular and easy
menstural cycle.
<4 * Improve func-
“ \ tionssuchasdi-

.~- gestion ‘and

that there is more energy available for the
growing child.

* Increase the supply of fresh_ blood to the brain
thus enhancing the mental capacity.

* Strengthen the nerves whereby the endur-
ance capacity improves.

* Promote proper structural development by
working the joints.

The Psychological Importance of Yoga-

asanas for Adolescents

The important psychological and emotional ben-

efits of the Yoga-asanas are that they:

* Help a child to become self-controlled and
less prone to extremes of behaviour (which
tends to occur during adolescence) by regu-
lating.endocrinal functions.

* Check excessive aggression and excitability
through the regulation of the adrenal glands.

* Correct brooding and melancholy in girls by
regulating pituitary and pineal functions.

* Check laziness and lethargy which some-
times characterizes this phase.

Yoga for Children / 141

142 | Yoga for Children

* Buildupself-confidence. Remove shyness and

self-consciousness.

Control the arousal of the emerging sexual

urge.

Direct the new found energy into creative

outlets.

Create predisposition towards Yogic prin-

ciples of yama and niyama so developing a

child’s moral-ethical character.

Notes on Yoga-asanas for Adolescents

Asanas are not merely physical movements.

They have a far reaching impact on a growing

child. Here are few examples:.

* The Standing Poses develop the physique and
build up stamina, remove stiffness and leth-
argy.

* The Sun Salutation Poses (the Jumpings)
build up strength and stamina. They bring
freshness and remove torpidity.

* The Inverted Poses sharpen the intellect.
They strengthen the nerves andhelp regulate
endocrinal functioning.

* The Cross Legged Poses and Sitting Poses
create mobility in the hip, knee and
ankle joints. They improve the
breathing and make the mind alert.

* The Forward Bending Poses bring sobriety
and calm the emotions.

* The Twisting Poses strengthen the back. They
create calmness and reduce excitation. .

* The Prone and the Backward Bending Poses
remove dullness and provide energy,

* The Balancing Poses are challenging and
expressive. On performing them a child feels

a sense of achievement. They build up self.
confidence.

* The Leg Movement Poses bring strength,
flexibility and alignment to the joints and
muscles of the legs.

* TheBody Knotting Poses are challenging and
demanding. They are most useful in improv-
ing the blood circulation in the vital organs.

During Menstruation:

Ideally, one should rest during menstruation for
about two days. If, however, girls wish to prac-
tice Yoga-asanas during menstruation, itis quite
safe to do all the asanas except for the inverted
poses which should not be done on any account.
Should a girl have excessive pain or bleeding or
any other abnormality, the following asanas
are highly recommended. Supta Vira-asana,
Matsya-asana, followed by all the Forward Bend-
ing Poses, followed by Viparita Danda-asana on
a chair or bench, Setu Bandha Sarvanga-asana
on a bench and finally Shava-asana.

5. The Yoga Syllabus

By Geeta Iyengar

Yoga is a vast and multi-faceted subject. Teach-
ers are perplexed as to which aspect of Yoga
should be introduced in schools.

Yoga-asanas are the aspect of Yoga which should
be introduced in schools. Asana is the only limb
of Yoga that can be directly imparted. Properly
taught and practiced, the Yoga-asanas will pro-
vide the children sound physical and mental
health and lead to balanced growth. Children are
basically active and outgoing by nature. They
enjoy the action, movement and creativity that
the asanas provide and will readily take to them.
Furthermore, the asanas are safe and can easily
be taught and corrected. By exposing the chil-
dren to Yoga-asanas at the middle school level,
interest in the subject of Yoga will be created at
the right age. Later, at the college level, when
these children are moremature, they can take up
the higher aspects of Yoga such as pranayama,
meditation and philosophy.

Which and How Many Asanas Should Chil-
dren Learn

A question is often raised as to which and how
many asanas shouldbe taughtin schools. Unfortu-
nately, most schools and Yoga teachers have con-
fined their courses to a few basic asanas when
introducing Yoga as a subject i.e. Padmasana,
Matsyasana, Mayurasana, Dhanurasana (also

called Chakrasana), Bhujangasana, Shirsasana,
Sarvangasana, Halasana and a few others.
While teaching school children one should not
confine oneself tojust a few asanas. Children learn
quickly. Even if a child is allotted just one session
of Yoga in a week he can easily learn 30 to 40
asanas in the course of a year. Obviously, if chil-
dren have two or more sessions of Yoga a week,
they need a syllabus with many more asanas.
Children need variety and novelty. By practicinga
variety of asanas children can exploreawiderange
of movements. The novelty is necessary to keep
their interest in the subject alive. By repeating the
same poses in each class, the children get bored.
Though the asanas are age-old, the teacher must
be innovative to keep the child’s interest alive.
Progress cannot be made if the teacher insists that
the child perfects one asana before introducing
new asanas. While some important asanas have to
be taught and repeated in each session, there are
other asanas which one teaches only occasionally.
The perfection of some asanas depends on the
performance of several other asanas. For example,
if a group of children find it difficult to perform
Padmasana, they need to practice several poses
which are preparatory to Padmasana like:
Gomukhasana, Virasana, Eka Pada Bhekasana,
ArdhaBaddha Padmottanasana, Utthitha Hasta
Padangushthasana, Ardha Padmasana, etc. Simi-
larly, to improve Halasana the cycle of
Paschimottanasana-Halasana shouldbe practiced
regularly.

Yoga for Children / 143

144 | Yoga for Children

Sometimes Yoga teachers are apprehensive about
teaching children a variety ofasanas. For example,
someteachersareafraid toteach children Upavistha
Konasana,but in reality, Upavistha Konasana is
quite easy for children to attempt. Unfortunately,
some Yoga teachers do not practice a wide range of
asanas themselves. They impose their limitations
on the children and they judge the students’ capa-
bilities by their own limited capacities.

Shirsasana for Children

Some Yoga teachers are afraid to teach children
Shirsasana fearing that it may strain the brain
and harm the child. These fears are totally un-
founded. In fact, if Shirshasana is practiced prop-
erly, itremoves fatigue and rejuvenates the brain.
Since children have to study a lot, they should
practice Shirsasana regularly.

Helpful Asanas during Exams

During exams children should practice several
Inverted asanas such as Shirsasana,
Sarvangasana, Halasana, Setubandha
Sarvangasana and Viparita Karani. These
asanasstimulate andhelp torelieve tension. The
lateral twist ofthe spine removes back-achesand
neck pain. Shanmukhi Mudra relaxes the eyes.
In fact, the Yoga syllabus for children should
include asanas which remove fatigue and
mental strain.

Syllabus and Guidelines

A complete and comprehensive syllabus is re-
quired to teach Yoga-asana in schools. With a rigid
syllabus, however, children tend to lose interest in
the class. The syllabus should begin with simple
asanas and proceed towards complicated asanas.
The children should first be taught the asanas
which correct anatomical defects and create
strength and flexibility. Having prepared the foun-
dation properly, the teacher should proceed to
teach more complicated asanas which effect the
physiology and psychology of the child. Below is a
general guideline which suggests the basic re-
quirements and sequence of the Yoga course.

2. The Sitting Asanas ie. Virasana

SA oo

=

10.The Leg-Movement Asanas i.e. Supta
Padangushthasana

11. The Body-Knotting Asanasi.e. Yoganidrasana.

Yoga-asanas are often mistaken for contortions
of the body. The teacher should explain that the
skilful practitioner does not contort the body.
Skill in the performance of Yoga-asanas means
the correct placement of the limbs, muscles and
organs in the different postures.

Finally, one should note that the Yoga-asanas
must be taught to children in a manner appeal-
ing to them, i.e., full of speedy and dynamic
movements. If Yoga teachers fail to understand
the psychology of children then “Yoga for Chil-
dren” will be a big failure (See “The Dynamic
Approach for Children”).

On Teaching Yoga Theory

The theoretical aspects of Yoga can be intro-
duced at the high school level but a sevarate

theory class should not be allotted. Children do
not enjoy formal classes on Yoga theory. If, on
the other hand, the teacher mentions the impor-
tance of Yoga-asanas while teaching the asanas,
the child will be attentive. Anatomy and physi-
ology and many other aspects can be taught in
this casual manner. Children also love listening
to the meanings and the mythological stories
underlying the names of asanas.

Occasionally short talks can be given on topicssuch as:
What is Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, Bahiranga Sadhana,
morality. These talks will add to their knowledge (See
Chapter “Yoga Theory for Children”).

The teacher must not attempt to teach erudite
concepts of Patanjali Yoga Sutras such as kriya
Yoga, samapatti and samadhi. This sort of ab-
stract theory is not appropriate for children as
they can’t relate such concepts to their day to day
lives and personal experiences. The teacher must
use simple explanations and information.

Yoga for Children / 145

By Geeta Iyengar

If children are taught too many static asanas,
where they have to hold the pose and make
thoughtful adjustments, they will get bored and
distracted. Children need activity and enjoy
motion. Children, therefore, must be taught
asanas primarily in a dynamic way involving
many speedy, forceful and energeticmovements.

Dynamic movements activate unused joints and
muscles. Stiff bodies are thereby made supple,
preparing children for asanas that they could not
previously do easily. New movementsare achieved.
The dynamic and speedy movements also have a
positive effect on the mind. They destroy lethargy
and remove fear complexes that hinder free move-
ments. They instill courage in the children and
perform a literal ‘brain washing’ which makes the
children feel fresh.

6. The Dynamic Approach for Children

To achieve a dynamic effect asanas should be
combined together and performed in quick gue.
cession. Initially, the emphasis must be on speed
while performing these asanas, but later speed
must be combined with accuracy and grace,
Here are a few examples of how asanas can be
combined or strung together:

a) PerformtheSurya Namaskar Cycle(also called
the Jumping Poses). These include Tadasana,
Urdhva Hastasana, Uttanasana, Adho Mukha
Shvanasana, Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana,
Chaturanga Dandasana and reverse backina
similar manner. These six poses can be
practiced in various permutations and
combinations.

146 / Yoga for Children

:

b) Perform all the Standing Poses at a stretch without returning to Tadasana each time.

c) sec all the Standing Poses continuously on the right side and finish with Tadasana.
en perform the Standing Poses continuously on the left side.

d) Blend the asanas: Utthitha Trikonasana, Ardha Chandrasana, Virabhadrasana II,
Parivritta Parshvakonasana, Parivritta Trikonasana, Parshvottanasana, Urdhva Prasarita
Eka Padasana, UttithaHasta Padangusthasana. Do these on the right side at a stretch
without giving a break. The same cycle can be repeated on the left side. This can, again, have
several permutations and combinations.

If the students are taught in this manner they
develop grace, skill, freedom, courage, quick-
ness, steadiness, 4 sense of balance, agility,
suppleness, sharpness and physical and mental
control. The teacher can and should add several

150 / Yoga for Children

different permutations and combinations to the
above mentioned examples. Thereby the chil-
dren will enjoy the variety and change and
derive many benefits at the same time.

Pranayama, Shatkriyas and Bandhasare Not for Children

By Geeta Iyengar

Having considered what should be included in
the Yoga syllabus for children, let us now con-
sider which aspects of Yoga should be omitted.

Pranayama - Controlled and Volitional
Breathing

One must caution Yoga teachers against teach-
ing children pranayama as it is not suited to the
nature of children. Pranayama demands steadi-
ness, seriousness andkeen observation, whereas
children are playful, naughty and restless by
nature. The mass psychology of children is such
that when they are together they can’t easily be
serious nor can they be easily controlled. Ifthey
are asked to keep their eyes closed for too long
they burst out laughing. Also if the instructor
points out some anatomical detail the children
laugh and become mischievous. Children physi-
cally can’t cope with pranayama. If children are
asked to sit quietly they drop the spine (though
while practicing asanas they can activate the

spine better than adults). Furthermore, if chil-

a

1. Normal 2. Inhale

dren are asked to breathe consciously, they
move the chest and abdomen dynamically and
mechanically.

On the mental plane, pranayama is a monoto-
nous and unexciting job for children and does not
provide any outlet for their creativity. They don’t
find anything expressive or impressive in it, nor
do they find any immediate results or any sense
of achievement in the practice of pranayama.

Physiologically, pranayama is inappropriate for
children. Bhastrika pranayama is dangerous for
children as they can definitely damage the deli-
cate blood vessels and brain cells. In fact,
pranayama may cause children to grow old pre-
maturely. Therefore, children should not be
taught pranayama.

How then should one prepare children for the
practice of pranayama which is important later
in life? If, while teaching asanas, older children
are made aware of their breathing pattern, that
is sufficient preparation for children.See below.

i
Ro he

5, Exhale and

4. Inhale
then normal

Yoga for Children / 151

When the children get tired per-
forming dynamic asanas, they
can be taught to rest with the
chest raised up and well opened.
They will recover quickly
thereby learning the importance
of correct breathing through
practical experience. Since
asanas cleanse the inner body,
certain asanaés can also be used
to prepare the children for
pranayama without touching on
the pranayamic process directly.

If, however, a teacher or parent
is very keen to teach children

pranayama, then Stage I of viloma pranayama
(interrupted inhalation) can be taught to them
for four to five minutes.

Shatikriyas - The Six Cleansing Practices

The Hatha Yoga Pradipika clearly states that
the shatkriyas are not meant for everyone.

These kriyas are only for those whose humours
are completely vitiated, for the diseased people.
These kriyas are habit forming; people who
habitually practice them will have trouble with
routine functions such as emptying the bowels
when not performing the kriyas.

The Science of Ayurveda also does not recom-
mend the shatkriyas for children.

162 | Yoga. for Children

According to Ayurveda, because children under

the age of fourteen years are of kapha prakriti,
they should avoid all shodhana kriyas

(purifying treatments) like the shatkriyas. |

Instead , children should be treated by
shamana kriyas (pacifying treatments).

Furthermore, the shatkriyas are impractical
and there is the problem of hygiene such as the

availability of clean thread, clean water and |

other facilities required for the kriyas. In fact,
saucha (cleanliness), the first of the niyamas
prescribed by Patanjali, is sufficient for children.
Teaching children to brush their teeth, clean
their tongue, blow their nostrils lightly, move
their bowels regularly, bathe and cultivate good
habitsis enough for them. In addition, ifchildren
regularly practice Yoga-asanas their physiologi-
cal functions like digestion and excretion will
greatly improve.

Bandhas - Postures Which Affect Specific :

Contractions

Children should not be taught uddiyana and
other bandhas because by practicing these, chil-
dren become excessively conscious of their lower
abdomen and reproductive organs. In young
children these organs are functionally dormant.
If children practice these bandhas their physiol-
ogy will start functioning before puberty. As a
result,premature seminal discharge may occur
in boys. It would be damaging to the children’s
health to make their physiology mature while
they are still mentally immature. Thus, children
should not be taught the bandhas.

8. MoreAsanas for Children

Because novelty and variety are the keys for
teaching Yoga-asanas to children, we have de-
scribed:40 more asanas here. If these asanas
alongwith the 75 asanas presented in the earlier
part of this book are taught to children in differ-
ent permutations and combinations and with
varying areas of emphasis, children will remain
absorbed by the subject. of Yoga for years.

Many of the asanas explained here are variations
of the asanas already described in the earlier part
of this book. Somme asanas are new and difficult.

Asanas marked with one asterisk may be inte-
grated into Course I of the practice sequences,
those marked with two asterisks into Course II
and those marked with three asterisks into
Course III.

Yoga for Children / 163

9. Yoga Props for Children

Yoga props are supports or aids for learning and
teaching Yoga-asanas. Yogacharya B.K.S Iyengar
has created numerous Yoga props to assist patients
in Yoga therapy and to help Yoga practitioners
learn the classical Yoga-asanas.

In this chapter we have, confined ourselves to using
only simple objects from everyday life when de-
scribing how Yoga props can be used by children.
These will help a child develop strength and flex-
ibility and provide variety in a child’s Yoga practice.
The Floor: A line on the floor can be a useful
learning and teaching aid. Teach children to stand
~ on a line and align their bodies viz-a-viz the lines
while practicing asanas, particularly the Standing
Poses. This teaches them the basis of alignment in
Yoga-asanas. .

The Wall: Walls can serve as useful props: They
provide invaluable support when a child begins
learning Inverted Poses like Shirsha-asana and
Adho Mukha Vriksha-asana.

Learning Shirsha-asana Against A Wall.

1. Place your blanket against a wall preferably in a
corner or against an edge where two walls meet.

2. Rest your forearms on the blanket and interlock
your fingers. The knuckles must touch the wall.

3. Come into an inverted position. Be sure that
you are not tilted to a side.

4. Only the heels should rest against the wall.
Broaden and lift your shoulders. Tighten the
buttock muscles, Stay a while,

Difficult arm - balancing poses like Baka-asana
can also be learned with the help of a wall, resting

164 / Yoga for Children the toes against a wall.

Children can gain confidence and flexibility by

practicing Urdhva Dhanur-asana using the wall

for support. (See page 159)

The wall can also provide resistance whereby

the pupils can improve their pose as in Adho

Mukha Shava-asana.(Place fingers against a wall)

Wall Ropes:(Traditionally called Yoga Kurunta)
Awide range of movements can be performed on
wall ropes. These movements create flexion and
extension and are very good for developing a
growing child’s muscles and promoting growth.
Besides strengthening the back and making the

spine supple, they also ienable the children to
perform difficult poses, One could loop ropes

around step ladders ina g8ymnasium or hooks on
a wall.

The Coiling Ropes: Ropes can also bo sus-
pended from raflors or from hooks in the ceiling
_ Children love to hang upside down in ‘Ropo
Shirsha-asana’ from those coiling ropes. This
Stross-free version of Shirsha-asana is beneficial
for all children because the brain and the pineal
and pituitary glands are supplied with fresh
blood in this position, Even a boginner can stay
comfortably in this inverted position.

The Chair: Sarvanga- asana can be done with
the help of chair, Here is the method:

Place a bolster or two folded blankets near the front
legs of a chair, Then sit side-ways on the chair.
Swing your legs onto the back rest of the chair and
hold the sides of the back-rest.

Gradually lean back till your shoulders rest on the
bolster or blankets and rest the back of your head on
the floor,

Extend your arms backwards within the legs of the
chair and hold the back legs of the chair, if possible.

It is easy for a child to stay a while in Sarvanga-asana
performed in this manner. This pose is very effective in
removing fatigue and refreshing the child. The inversion
leads to healthy blood circulation in the thyroid gland
and the brain.

Chairs can also provide useful support to prepare the
back for Backward-Bending Poses. Here is the method
to perform Viparita Danda-asana on the chair.

Insert your legsin the gap between the backrest and

Hold the back rest, bend your knees and gradually

Insert your arms between the legs of the chair

Straighten your knees and press your toes and heels
to the wall.

iff or heavy children are not able to raise
eeesalves off the floor in Urdhva Dhanur-
asana. Resting their hands on bricks placed
against a wall, (orona ledge about five inches
high) will enable them to lift up more easily,

The Bench: Benches can be put to good use to
support children in Setu Bandha Sarvanga-asana.
This resting pose performs wonders to calm the
nerves, rest the brain and refresh the child. This
pose can be done by girls during menstruation.

Since children find Forward Bending Poses dif-
ficult and unappealing, the teacher can make
these poses more endurable for children by ask-
ing a child to sit on a bench, the heels on the floor,
and then to bend forward.

A bench can also serve as a support to perform Half
Hala-asana: rest the toes on a bench.

The Brick: Stiff children can’t do Ardha
Chandra-asana easily as their palms don’t reach
the floor. They tend to get disheartened with
such poses. A vertical brick gives them the
support they require tolearn the pose. Over time
the brick can be placed horizontally and when
they advance in their practice they can dispense
with it.

A brick provides useful resistance between the
palms when older children learn to perform
Pincha Mayura-asana.

166 / Yoga for Children

ye Belt: Most children find it difficult to keep

eir elbows parallel to each other in Sarvanga-
asana. They tend to spread their elbows too far
apart. This leads to a faulty pose where the tail-
bone projects back and the legs come forward. A
belt can be used effectively to keep the elbows in
place and so correct this defect.

Some children find it difficult to stay a while in
Padma-asana or to perform variations like
Matsya-asana. A belt can be used to bind the
knees so that children can learn to perform these
poses properly.

Pillows and Bolsters: Pillows and bolsters are
especially useful when a child is suffering from
some ailment or injury. They can be used to give
support to the unwell child in several ways, to
provide relief and help in recuperation.

Blankets: Beginners have trouble staying in
Sarvanga-asana for a few minutes. They can be
taught to do this in the following manner:

1. Placetwoor three neatly folded blankets one
a top the other on the floor.

2. Lieon your back with your shoulders resting
on the blankets, the neck on the edge and the
back of the head on the floor.

3. Then perform Sarvanga-asana.
When Sarvanga-asana is done in this manner
children can lift the spine up, open the chest and

stay a while in the pose. This is particularly
useful for fat children.

Yoga for Children / 167.

10. Yoga Theory for Children

This chapter contains a selection of theoretical and philosophi-
cal topics which will enricha child’s understanding of Yoga: The
most effective manner of presenting this matter to children
would be to talk informally and spontaneously during the
course of the regular asana classes. The teacher should use
plenty of stories, examples and anecdotes and the subject
should be made relevant to the lives of children. Only the
simplest aspects of theory ought to be presented to the little
children, for example moral stories on yama, niyama, prayers
and about the origin of asana.

WHAT IS YOGA?

The word Yoga means to join, unite or merge. It is derived
from the sanskrit root yuj. Yoga is a science and an art. The
practice of Yoga integrates the body with the mind and the
mind with the soul, thereby helping us to understand our own
natures and to live harmoniously with our fellow men.

Yoga can be practiced by all irrespective of race, colour, caste,
creed, sex and age.

Most people are aware of only two aspects of Yoga, the asanas
and meditation. Yoga is more than these two aspects. It is, in
fact, an eight-fold path called Ashtanga Yoga.

ASHTANGA YOGA-The Eight Fold Path
Ashtanga Yoga or the eight limbs of Yoga are:
i) Yama The univergal commandments. These are:

Ahimsa - Non-violence
Satya - Truth and honesty

a - Non-covetousnesg
Brahmacharya- Continence and self-control
Aparigraha

.

- Nonaccumulation of needleas wealth

168 / Yoga for Children

ii) Niyama - The personal disciplines, These _
Saucha - Cleanliness and purity :
Santosha - Satisfaction and contentment
Tapas - Austerity, ability to bear hardship
Svadhyaya - Introspection
Ishvara
Pranidhana - Faith in God

iii) Asana - Postures

iv) Pranayama -
v) Pratyahara -

Control of breath and bio-energy
Withdrawal ofthe sense organs from the
objects of sense

vi) Dharana - Intense concentration for developing in-

ner vision

vii) Dhyana - Meditation, uninterrupted and deep con-
centration for a prolonged period

viii) Samadhi - The goal of Yoga, attained after a pro-

longed period of dhyana. Just as a river
merges into the ocean and becomes one
with it, so also the individual self merges
intotheUniversal Spirit and becomes one.
Peace and happiness are experienced as
all polarities such as pain and pleasure,
good and bad vanish.

Only the first three limbs of Ashtanga Yoga, yama, niyama and
asana are relevant for children.

SADHANA - The Quest

Sadhana implies a quest or study.
Therearethree kinds of sadhanas.

Bahiranga Sadhana (bahir-
outer, anga - body) is the quest
for external purity. Bahiranga
sadhana consists of following
the moral and ethical principles of yama and niyama -
character building, and the practice of asanas for cleansing an
maintaining the health of the body.

Antaranga Sadhana (antar-inner, anga - body) is the quest
for inner purity. In antaranga sadhana the practitioner
strives to cleanse and control his mind and his senses
through the practice of pranayama and pratyahara.

Antaratma Sadhana (antar - inner, atma - soul, self) is
the quest of the soul. Here the aspirant penetrates into the
innermost aspects of his being through the practice of
dharana, dhyana and samadhi.

Only bahiranga sadhana is for children.

PRAYERS

Prayers are a part of bahiranga sadhana. Children enjoy
praying, especially praying aloud. Children are essentially
pious by nature, free from doubts and biases.

Prayers inspire a child towards betterment. They help mould
a character which is respectful, revential and devout. Repeti-
tion of prayers before Yoga classes helps “set the mood”.
Children immediately calm down.

A few sanskrit prayers are given below. These can
be repeated before and after the Yoga classes.
These prayers are dedicated to Sage Patanjali, the
founder of Yoga, to one’s Guru and to the great
Gods who create, sustain and dissolve the world
(teachers may instead use prayers from their own
tradition).

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY

Regular practice of the asanas ignites a child’s
curiosity about human anatomy and physiology.
Likewise, knowledge about anatomy and
physiology renders the study ofasanas extremely
interesting. During the course of aregular asana
class the teacher can easily point out and name
the important bones and muscles of the body.

Children learn subjectively about their bodies
by practicing the Yoga asanas because every
part of the body comes into play while perform-
ing these varied movements. During the course
ofan asana class the teacher should also indicate
how the asanas work and benefit different parts
of the child’s body.

NAMES OF ASANAS

Children like learning the names of asanas,
saying them aloud and pronouncing them cor-
rectly. They wish to understand the meaning of
the names of asanas and to hear the stories,
myths and legends underlying these names.

Because many asanas are inspired by nature
and animals, the teacher could also trace and
relate these asanas to their sources, Children
are fascinated by the natural world and this
approach inspires them tolearn and practice the
asanas.

GURU-SHISYA - The Teacher and the Pupil

A sound relationship between the guru and the
shisya, the master and pupil, is the foundation for
progress on the path of Yoga.

Gu means darkness and ru means light. The Gury
is therefore the spiritual teacher, the guide, the
master who leads us out of the darkness of
ignorance into the light of knowledge. A gura
oversees the progress of his pupil in every aspect
of life; physical, moral, emotional and intellectuz].
He guides his disciples with faith, compassion and
patience.

Ashisya or pupil can be of four kinds. The ancient Stizc
Samhita text describes them as follows:

The mrud is the feeble student. He has bad habits
and a bad character. He criticizes his teacher and
others and is cowardly.

The madhyama is the average student. He is
moderate in his ways and wishes to improve
himself.
The adhimatra is the good student. He is noble,
truthful, brave, respectful and intent on the prac-
tice of Yoga.
The adhimatratama is the most superior student.
Heis of very good character, courageous, free from
fear and independent, intelligent, studious and
learned in the scriptures. He is self-controlled,
regular in food, clean, generous, helpful, forgiving
and gentle in speech. He is firm and not moody. He
is worshipful of his Guru.
PURUSHA-ARTHAS - The Aims of Life
The ancient sages observed that man has four
basic instincts or aims in life, known as the
purusha-arthas. Theseare; dharma, artha, kama
and moksha.

Dharma is the urge towards right thinking and
right living.

Artha is the urge to earn honestly and acquire
material wealth.

Kama is the urge to experience and enjoy the
pleasures of life.

Mokshais the ultimate urge or aim to renounce
the world and attain spiritual liberation.

FOUR ASHRAMAS:SStages of Life

To enable man to fulfil his four basic urges and
aims, the ancients prescribed a four-fold division
ofaman’s life span. These four divisions or stages
are called ashramas. Each ashrama is, theoreti-
cally, of twenty five years duration.
Brahmacharya ashrama is the first stage in a
person'slife, that ofa celibate student. The person
lives a disciplined life devoted to studies (particu-
larly, moral and religious).

Grahastya ashrama is the second stage, that of
amanasahouse-holder. The manmarries, begets
children, works andearns in order to maintain his
family.

Vanaprastha ashrama is the third stage. With
his children grown-up, the man now retires from
worldly affairs and active family life. Heserves as
a counsellor to his family, meanwhile preparing
himself inwardly for total withdrawal.
Sanyasa ashrama is the final stage in a man's
life wherein he renounces all worldly bonds. He
devotes himself entirely to the service of Godand
the attainment of salvation.

FOUR MARGS - Paths to Salvation

For attaining the cherished goal of salvation, the

ancients laid down four paths or margs known as
Jnana, Karma, Bhakti and Yoga.

Jnana marg - The Path of knowledge. Discrimi-
nating between whatis right and wrong, real and
unreal.

Karma marg - The Path of Action. Serving hu-
manity without any thought of reward.
Bhakti marg- The Path of Devotion.Developing
love and oneness with God and all creation.
Yoga marg - The Path of Integration.Cleansing
the body, controlling and senses and restraining
the fluctuations of the mind.

SHAD DARSHANA.- Six Views

Amongst Hindus there are six orthodox schools of
philosphy which explain the nature of man and
the universe. These six different views are known
as shad darshana. All six darshanas are basedon
the sacred Vedic texts, they endorse rebirth and
they all aim at salvation. These six darshanas
are:

Nyaya - Founder Gautama. Based on logic and
reason,

Vaisheshika - Founder Kanada. Stresses no-
tions on space, time, matter, cause, etc. and is
supplementary to nyaya.

Samkhya - Founder Kapila. Gives a view of
creation based on 25 different elements.

Yoga - Founder Patanjali. Provides’a practical -
and dynamic path to salvation (i.e. Ashtanga
Yoga).Follows the samkhya view of creation but
adds to it the beliefin God.

Mimamsa - Founder J aimini. Stresses right ac-
tion and the performance of religious rituals as
explained in the Vedas.

Yoga for Children / 171

Vedanta -Founder Badarayana. Emphasizes the
path of knowledge and the search for the deep
truths found in the Vedas.

IMPORTANT TEXTS
The most important text for the study of Yoga is
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. In merely 196 aphorisms
Patanjali expounds a most brilliant and profound
philosophy. This text consists of four chapters
called padas.
Samadhi pada — The first chapter is intended for
the advanced practitioner. It deals with experi-
ences just preceding samadhi.
Sadhana pada - Is for the novice andexplains how
to begin.
Vibhuti pada - Speaks of miraculous powers
and cautions against them.

Kaivalya pada — Explains the state of kaivalya,
the apex of Yoga.

The Mahabharata, Ramayana, relevant portions
of the Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads and sto-
ries from the Puranas provide great inspiration

to children.
HATHA YOGA AND RAJA YOGA

Hatha means force or determination. Force and
determination are required to practice Hatha
Yoga. In addition ha means sun and tha means
moon; just as positive and negative currents
produce energy, Hatha Yoga also produces en-
ergy and force.

Raja means a king.. Raja Yoga leads to
over one’s body and mind. . atin

172 | Yoga for Children

The classical text on Yoga, Hatha Yoga Pradipika
states that both Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga lead
to the same goal, liberation.

Yogacharya B.K:S. Iyengar explains, “Both are
Moksha Shastras (Sciences of Freedom). They
guide man to climb the ladder of spirituality.
Hatha Yoga starts with the body and ends with
the soul. Raja Yoga starts with the mind and
climbs down the body and uplifts again. Both
criss-cross other and reach the destiny of peace,

poise and plenty.”

As YOGA BECOMES more popular throughout the world, there is
a pressing need for a good book on Yoga for children which is both
authoritative and appealing, informative and enjoyable. |

The authors of this book fulfil this need admirably. They trace the
roots of Yoga in mythology and legend, and include many stories and
tales bringing out the quality of, and inspiration for, the postures. They
also stress the links of the postures to the natural world — trees,
mountains, flowers, animals. They emphasise the universal moral and
ethical values implicit in the practice of Yoga such as non-violence,
truth, self-discipline, simplicity and contentment. Besides they highlight
the geometrical forms and precision in the postures, so that children
can relate to these abstract concepts through what they have learnt in.
their body movements.

Each Yoga posture is explained through photographs, drawings,
stories and detailed instructions with stick figures illustrating several stages
in performing the pose. Important ‘dos and don’ts’ and the benefits of
each pose are also given.

The highlight of the book is a detailed section meant for parents
and teachers comprising specific guidance on keeping children practising
Yoga creatively, enjoyably and safely.

S wati and Rajiv Chanchani have been practising and teaching Yoga
under the guidance of Yogacharya B.K.S. lyengar since 1975. Currently
they teach Yoga at the Welham Girls’ High School and the Doon School,
Dehradun. Besides they also run a Yoga Centre at the hill resort of
Mussoorie. They have two young sons who also enjoy doing Yogasanas.
