But this criticism loses all its force if we inform ourselves of the definition of Veda given by Sri Sa~ikariciir~a himself as quoted below : 1 \"The very word 'Veda' has this derivational meaning i.e. the fountain- head and illimitable store-home of all knowledge. This derivation, in effect, means, connotes and impliea that the Vedas e M oontoin (~talics mine) within themwlvea all the knowledge needed by mankind relating pot only to the 60- called 'spiritual' (or other-worldly) matters but also to those usually dascnbed aa purely 'neonlar', 'temporal', or 'worldly' and also to the means required by I humaniay ae such for the aohievemsnt of all-round, complete and perfect succeas in all conoeivable directions and that there oan be no adjechval or restrictive epithet calcnlated (or tending) to limit that knowledge down in any ephere, any direction or any respect whatsoever. \"In other words, it connotes and impliea that our pncient Indian Vedic lore shouL1 be (italics mine) all-round, complete and perfect and able to throw the fullest necessary light on all matters which any aspiring seeker after know- ledge can possibly seek to he enlightened on\".

That approach entirely turns the tables on all critics, for the authorship of Vedic mathematics then need not be laboriously searched in the texts as preserved from antiquity. The Vedas are well known as four in nunlher Rk, Yaju, SHma and Atharva but they have also the four Upavedas and the six VedHligas all of which form an indivisible corpus of divine knowledge as it once was and as it may be revealed. The four Upavedas are as follows :- Veda Upaveda Rgveda hyurveda Simaveda GLnd harvaveda Yajurveda Dhahurveda Atharvaveda SthLpathyaveda In this list the Upaveda of SthHpatya or engineering com- prises all kinds of architectural and structural human endeavour and all visual arts. Swamiji naturally regarded mathematics or the science of calculations and computations to fall under this category. In the light of the above definition and approach must be understood the author's statement that the sixteen Sfitms on which the present volume is based form part of a Pariiiista of the Atharvaveda. We are aware that each Veda has its subsi- diary apocryphal texts some of which remain in manu8cripts and others have been printed but that formulation has not closed. For example, some Paribistas of the Atharvaveda were edited by G. M. Rolling and J. Von Negelein, Liepzing, 1909-10. But this work of Sri SaiikarZo?oBryaji deserves to be regarded as a new Paribista by itself and it is not surprising that the Sctras mentioned herein do not appear in the hitherto known P a d - istas. A list of these main 16 Siitras and of their sub-sutras or corollaries is prefixed in the beginning of the text and the style of language also points to their discovery by Sri SwZmiji himself. At any rate, it is needless to dwell longer on this point of origin since the vast merit of these rules should be a matter of discovery for each intelligent reader.

He was an ardent admirer of Bhartrhari the great scientific thinker of the Golden Age of Indian history in a different field viz, that of philosophy of grammar. Swamiji had planned to write 16 volumes on all aspects and branches of mathematical processes and problems and there is no doubt that his mental powers were certainly of that calibre, but what has been left to us is this introductory volume which in itself is of the highest merit for reason of presenting a new technique which the author styles as \"mental\" mathematics different from the orthodox methods of mathematicians all over the world. Arithmetical problems usually solved by 18, 28 or 42 steps in case of such vulgar fractions as 1/19, 1/29, 1/49 are here solved in one simple line and that is possible to be done even by young boys. The truth of these methods was demons- trated by this saintly teacher before many University audiences in India and in the U.S.A. including learned Professors and every one present was struck with their originality and simplicity.

With the late $a6kar~- clrya we belong to a race, now fast becoming extinct, of die- hard believers who think that the Vedas represent an inexhaus- tible mine of profoundest,wisdom in matters both spiritual and temporal ; and that. this store of wisdom was not, as regards its assets of fundamental validity and value at lest, gathered by the laborious inductive and deductive methods of ordinary systematic enquiry, but was a direct gift of revelation to seers and sages who in their higher reaches of Yogic realization were competent to receive it from a Source, perfect and immaculate. But we admit, and the late $ankadc&rya has also practically admitted, that one cannot expect to convert or revert criticism, much less carry conviction, by merely asserting one's staunchest beliefs. To meet these ends, one must be prepared to go the whole length of testing and verification by accepted, accredited methods. The late $ a ~ i k a r ~ c ~ r ~ a has, by his comparative and critical study of Vedic mathematics, made this essential requirement in Vedic studies abundantly clear. So let us agree to gauge Vedic mysteries not as we gauge the far-off nabulae with the poet's eye or with that of the seer, but with the alert, expert, scrutinizing eye of the physical astronomer, if we may put it as that. That there is a consolidated metaphysical background in the Vedas of the objective sciences including mathematics as regards their basic conceptions is a point that may be granted by a thinker who has looked broadly and deeply into both the realms. In our paper recently published-'The Metaphysics of Physics'-we attempted to look into the mysteries of creative enlergeuce as contained in the well-known cosmogenic Hymn (Rg. X.190) with a view to unveiling the metaphysical background where both ancient wisdom and modern physics may meet on a common basis of logical understanding, and compare notes, discovering, where possible, points of significant or suggestive parallelism between the two sets of concepts, ancient and modern. That metaphysical background includes mathematics also; because physics as ever pursued is the application of mathema- tics to given or specified space-time-event situations. There we examined Tapas as a fundamental creative formula whereby the Absolute emerges into the realms of measures, variations, limits, frame-works and relations.

The former gives the unconditioned, unrestricted how or thw of cosmic process ; the latter, what or that of existence. Tapas, which corresponds to ArdharnitrZ in Tantric symbolism, negotiates, in its rolc specially of critical variation, between what is, ab-initio, unconditioned and unrestricted, and what appears otherwise, as for instance, in our own universe of logico-mathematical appreciation. This is, necessarily, abstruse metaphysics, but it IS, nevertheless, the starting backgronnd of both physics and mathematics. But for all practical purposes we must come down from mystic nabulae to the terrajrma of our actual apprehension and appreciation. That is to say, we must descend to our own pragmatic levels of time-space-event situations. Here we face actual problems, and one must meet and deal with these aquarely without evasion or mystification. The late SalikarB- cLya has done this masterly feat with an adroitness that compels admiration. It follows from the fundamental premises that the universe we live in must have a basic mathematical structure, and consequently, to know a fact or obtain a result herein, to any required degree of precision, one must obey the rule of mathe- matical measures and relations. This, however, ore may do consciously or semi-consciously, systematically or haphazardly. Even some species of lower animals are by instinct gifted mathe- maticians ; for example, the migratory bird which flies t,housands of miles off f r m its nest-home, and after a period, unerringly returns. This 'implies a subconscious mathematical talent that works wonder. We may cite the case of a horse who was a mathematical prodigy and could 'tell' the result of a cube root (requiring 32 operations. according to M. Materlink in his 'Unknown Quest') in a twinkle of the eye. This sounds like magic, but it is undeniable that the feat of mathematics does sometimes assume a magical look. Man, undoubtedly, has been given his share of this magical gift. And he can improve upon it by practice and discipline, by Yoga and allied methods. This is undeniable also. Lztely, he has devised the 'automatic brain' for complicated calculations by science, that looks like magic.

But ordinarily he works as a logical entity requiring specified data or premises to start from, and more or less elaborate steps of reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. This is his normal process of induction and deduction. Here formulaj (Smras) and relations (e.g. equations) must obtain as in mathematics. The magic and logic of mathematics in some cases get mixed up ; but it is sane to keep them apart. You can get a result by magic, but when you are called upon to prove, you must have recourse to logic. Even in this latter case, your logic (your formule and applications) may be either simple a,nd elegant or complicated and cumbrous. The former is the ideal to aim at,. We have classical instances of master mathematicians whose methods of analysis and solution have been regarded as marvels of cogency, compactness and clcgancc. Some have bcen 'beautiful' as a poem (e.g. Lagrange's 'Analytical Mechanics.') The late Sa1ikar5c5rya has claimed, and rightly we may think, that the Vedic Sfitras and their applications possess these virtues to a degree of eminence that cannot be challenged. The outstanding merit of his work lies in his actual proving of this contention. Whether or not the Vedas be believed as repositories of perfect wisdom, it is unquestionable that the Vedic race lived nd as merely pastoral folk possessing a half-or-quarter-developed ! culture and civilization. The Vedic seers were, again, not mere 'navel-gazers' or 'nose-tip-gazers'. They proved themselves adepta in all levels and branches of knowledge, theoretical and I practical. For example, they had their varied objective science, both pure and applied. I Let us take a concrete illustration. Suppose in a time of I drought we require rains by artificial means. The modern scientist has his own theory and art (tecbique) for producing the result. The old seer scientist had his both also, but different from these now avai1ir.g. He had his science and technique, called Yajiia, in which Mantra, Yantka and other factors must CO-operate with mathematical determinateness and I precision. For this purpose, he had developed the six auxiliaries of the Vedas in each of which mathematical skill and adroitness, occult or otherwise, play the decisive role.

How were the Szitras obtained ?-by magic or logic or both ?-is a vital matter we do not dkcuss here. The late Salikaric~r~a has claimed for them cogency, compactness and simplicity. This is an even more vital point, and we think, he has reasonably made it good.

The method obviously is radically differnt from the one adopted by the modern mind. Music and not Mathematics is my field (although the philosophy of numbers, cosmic and metaphysical corres- pondences w~th musical numbers, the relation of numbers with consonant, dissonant and assonant tonal intervals etc., closely inter-relate music and mathematics), but study of the traditional literature on music and fine arts with which I have been concerned for the last few years has convinced me of one fundamental fact regarding the ancient Indian theory and method of knowledge and experience vis a vis the modern. While all great and true knowledge is born of intuition and not of any rational process or imagination. there is a radical difference between the ancient Indian method and the modem Western method concerning intuition. The divergence embraces everything other than the fact of intuition itself-the object and field of intuitive vision, the method of working out experience and rendering it to the intellect. The modern method is to get the intuition by sugges- tion from an appearance in life or nature or from a mental idea and even if the source of the intuition ie the soul, the method at once relates it to a support external to the", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

CONVENTIONAL TO UNCONVENTIONALLY ORIGINAL This book Vedic Mathematics deals mainly with various vedic mathematical formulae and their applications for carrying out tedious and cumbersome arithmetical operations, and to a very large extent, executing them mentally. In this field of mental arithmetical operations the works of the famous mathemati- cians Trachtenberg and Lester Meyers (High Speed Maths) are elementary compared to that of Jagadguruji. Some people may find it ditficult, at first reading, to understand the arithmetical operations although they have been explained very lucidly by Jagadguruji. It is not because the explanations are lacking in any manner but because the methods are totally unconventional. Some people are so deeply rooted in the con- ventional methods that they, probably, subconsciously reject to see the logic in unconventional methods. An attempt has been made in this note to explain the un- conventional aspects of the methods. Once the reader gets used to the unconventional in the beginning itself, he would find no difficulty in the later chapters. Therefore the explanatory notes are given for the first few chapters only.

Gurudeva has discussed the recurring decimals of 1/19, 1/29, etc. in chapter I to arouse curiosity and create interest. In conversion of vulgar fractions into their decimal equivalents Gurudeva has used very unconventional methods of multiplication and division. In calculation of decimal equivalent of 1/19, first method of the 'Ekidhika SLitra' requires multiplication of 1 by 2 by a special and unconventional process. Inconventional method product of 1, the multiplicand, by 2 the multiplier, is 2 and that is the end of multi- plication process. It is not so in the unconventional 'Ekidhika' method. In this method, in the above example, 1 is the first multi- plicand and its product with multiplier '2' is 2 which in this special process becomes the second multiplicand. This when multiplied by the multiplier (which remains the same) 2 gives the product as 4 which becomes the third multiplicand. And the process of multiplication thus goes on till the digits start recurring. Similarly in the second method of the 'Ek~dhika Sctra' for calculating the decimal equivalent of 1/19,*it is required to divide I by 2 by an unconventional and special process. In the conventional method when 1, the dividend, is to be divided by the divisor 'T, the quotient is 0.5 and the process of division ends. In the special method of 'Ekfidhika Siitra' for calculating decimal equivalents, the process starts by putting zero as the first digit of the quotient, 1 as the first remainder. A decimal point is put after the first quotient digit which is zero. NOW, the first remainder digit '1' is prefixed to the first quotient digit '0' to form '10' as the second dividend. Division of 10 by the divisor 2 (which does not change) gives 5 as the second quotient digit which is put after the decimal point. The second remainder digit '0' is prefixed to the second quotient digit 5 to form 5 as the third dividend digit. Division of 5 by 2 gives 2 as the third quotient digit and 1 as the third remainder digit which when prefixed to the third quotient digit '2' gives 12 as the fourth dividend and so the process goes on till the digits start recurring.

This vertical line should have as many digits to its right as there can be in the highest possi- ble remainder. In general the number of such digits are the same as in the figure which is one less than the divisor.

During his school days, he was a student of National College, Trichanapalli; Church Missionary Society College, Tinnevelli and Hindu College, Tinnevelli. Be passed his matriculation examination from the Madras University in January, 1899, topping the list as usual. He was extra-ordinarily proficient in Sanskrit and oratory and on account of this he was awarded the title of 'SARASWATI' by the Madras Sanskrit Association in July, 1899 when he was still in his 16th year. One cannot fail to mention at this stage the profound impremion left on him by his Sanskrit Guru Shri Vedam Venkatrai Shastri whom Jagadguruji always remembered with deepest love, reverence and gratitude, with tears in hia eyes. After e n i n g the highest place in the B.A. Examinanon, Shri Venkatraman Saraswati appeared at the M.A. Examination of the American College of Sciences, Rochester, New York, from Bombay Centre in 1903 ; and in 1904 at the age of just twenty he passed M.A. Examination in further seven subjects simul- taneously securing the highest honours in all, which is perhaps the all-time world-record of academic brilliance. His subjects included Sanskrit, Philosophy, English, Mathematics, History and hience. As a etudent Venkatraman was marked for his splendid brilliince, superb retentive memory and ever-insatiablt curiosity. He would deluge his teachers with myriads of piercing questions which made them uneasy and forced them frequently to make a frank confession of ignorance on their part. In this respect, he was considered to be a terribly mischievous student. Even from his University days Shri Venkatraman Saras- wati had started contributing learned articles on religion, philosophy, sociology, history, politics, literature etc., to late W. T. Stead's \"REVIEW OF REVIEWS\" and he was specially interested in all the branches of modern science. In fact, study of the latest researches and discoveries in modern science continued to be Shri Jagadguruji's hobby till his very last days.

In 1908, therefore, he proceeded to the Sringeri Math in Mysore to lay himself at the feet of the renowned late Jagadguru Shankaracharya Maharaj Shri Satchidiinanda Sivibhinava Nrisimha Bharati Swami: But he had not stayed there long, before he had to assume the post of the first Principal of the newly started National College at Rajmahendri under a preesing and clamant call of duty from tthe nationalist leaders. Prof. Venkatraman Saras- wati continued there for three years but in 1911 he could not resist his burning desire for spiritual knowledge, practice and attainment any more and, therefore, tsaring himself off suddenly from the said college he went back to Shri Satchidhanda Siviibhinava Nrisimha Bhkati Swami at Sringeri. The next eight years he spent in the profoundest study of the most adval~ced Vedanta Philosophy and practice of the Brahma-eadhnna. During these days Prof. Venkatraman used to study Vedanta at the feet of Shri Nrisimha Bhiirati Swami, teach Sanskrit and Philosophy in schools there, and practise the highest and most vigorous Yoga-siidhiina in the nearby forests. Frequently, he was also invited by several institutions to deliver lcctures on philosophy; for example he delivered a series of sixteen lectures on Shankarachnrya's Philosophy at Shankar Institutc of Philosophy, Amalner (Khan- desh) and similar lectures at several other places like Poona, Bombay etc. After several years of the most advanced studies, the deepest meditation, and the highest spiritual attainment Prof. Venkatra- man Saraswati was initiated into the holy order of SAMNYASA at Banaras (Varanasi) by his Holiness Jagadguru Shankara- charya Sri Trivikram Tirthaji Maharaj of Shgradgpeeth on the 4th July 1919 and on this occasion he was given the new name, Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha. This was the starting point of an effulgent manifestation of Swamiji's real greatness.

Jagadguru Shankaracharya Shri Madhusudan Tirtha of Govardhan Math Puri was at this stage greatly impressed by Jagadguruji and when the former was in failing health he requested.

Shri Jagadguruji continued to resist his importunate requests for a long time but at last when Jagadguru Shri hhdhu- sudan Tirtha's health took a serious turn in 1925 he virtually forced Jagadguru Shri Bharati Krishana Tirthaji to accept the Govardhan Matk{s Gadi and accordingly Jagadguruji installed Shri Swarupanandji on the Sharadapeeth Gadi and himself assumed the duties of the ecclesiastical and pontifical head of Sri Govardhan Math, Puri.

He took upon himself the colossal task of the renaissance of Indian culture, spreading of Sanatena Dharma, revival of the highest human and moral values and enkindling of the loftiest spiritual enlightenment throughout the world and he dedicated his whole life to this lofty and noble mission. Prom his very early days Jagadguruji was aware of the need for the right interpretation of \"Dharma\" which he, defined 8s \"the sum total of all the means necessery for speedily making and permanently keeping all the people, individually as well as collectively superlatively comfortable, prosperous, happy, and joyous in all respects (including the physicel, mental, intellectual, educational, economic, social, political, paycllic, spritual etc. ad injEnitum)\". He was painfully aware of the \"escapism\" of some from their duties under the garb of spiritua- lity and of the superficial modem educational varnish of the others, divorced from spiritual and moral standards.

He stood for the omnilateral and all-round progress aimultenaously of both the individual sand society towards the speedy realisation of India's spiritual and cultural ideal, the lofty Yedantic ideal of 'Piirnatva' (perfection and harmony all-round). With these ideas agitating his mind for several decades he went on carrying on a laboriou8, elaborate, patient and day- and-night research to evolve 6nally a splendid and perfect scheme for all-round reconstruction first of India and through it of the world.

In.trJ* R ~ W C ~ S on the Present Volume I now proceed to give a short account of the genesis of the work published herewith. Revered Guruji used to say that he had reconstructed the sixteen mathematical formulae (given in this text) from the Atharvaveds after assiduous rwarch and 'Tapas' for about eight years in the forests surrounding Sringeri. Obviously these formulae are not to be found in the present recensions of Atharvaveda ; they were actually reconstructed, on the basis of intuitive revelation, from materials scattered here and there in the Atharvaveda. Revered Gurudeva used to say that he had written sixteen volumes (one for each Siitra) on these Stitras and that the manuscripts of the said volumes were deposited at the house of one of his disciples. Unfortunately, the mid manuscripts were lost irretrievably from the place of their deposit and this colossal loss was &ally confirmed in 1956. Revered Gurudeva was not much perturbed over this irretrievable loss and used to say that everythmg was there in his memory and that he could re-write the 16 volums ! My late husband Sri C. M. Trivedi, Hon. Gen. Secertary V. P. Sangh noticed that while Sri Jagadguru Maharaj was busy demonstratirig before learned people and societies Vedic Mathematics as discovered and propounded by him, some persons who had grasped a smattering of the new Siitras had already started to dazzle audiences as prodigies claiming occult powers without aknowledging indebtedness to the Sfitras of Jagadguruji. My husband, therefore, pleaded earnestly with Gurudeva and persuaded him to arrange for the publication of the Siitras in his own name. In 1957, when he had decided finally to undertake a tour of the U.S.A. he re-wrote from memory the present volume, giving an introductory account of the sixteen for- mulae reconstructed by him. This volume was written in his old age within one month and a half with his failing health and weak eyesight.

The very word \"Veda\" has this derivational meaning i.e. the fountain-head and illimitable store-house of all know- ledge. This derivation, in effect, mcans,condotes and implies that the Vedas should contain within themselves all the knowledge needed by mankind relating not only to the so-called 'spiritual' (or other-worldly) matters but also to those usually described a8 purely \"secular\", \"temporal\", or \"wordly\"; and also to the means required by humanity as such for the achievement of all-round, complete and perfect success in all conceivable directions and that there can be no adjectival or restrictive epithet calculated (or tending) to limit that knowledge down in any sphere, any direction or any respect whatsoever. 3. In other words, it connotes and implies that our ancient Indian Vedic lore should be all-round complete and perfect and able to throw the fullest necessary light on all matters which any aspiring seeker after knowledge can possibly seek to be enlightened on. ( xiv ) 4. It is thus in the fitness of things that the Vedas include (i) Ayurveda (anatomy, physiology, hygiene, sanitary science, medical science, surgery etc., etc.,) not far the purpose of achic- ving perfect health and strength in the after-death future but in order to attain them here and now in our present physical bodies; (ii) Dhanurveda (archcry and other military sciences) not for fighting with one another after our transportation to heaven but in order to quell and subdue all invaders from abroad and all insurgents from within; (iii) GCndharva Veda (the science and art of music) and (iv) Sthcipatya Veda (engineer- ing, architecture etc.,antl alI branches of mathematics in general). All these subjects, be it noted, are inherent parts of the Vedas , i.e. arc reckoned as \"spiritual\" studies and catered for as I such therein. 5. Similar is the case with regard to t)lle Vedciligas (i.e. grammar, prosody, astronomy, lexicography etc., etc.,) which, according to the Indian cultural conceptions, are also inherent parts and subjects of Vedic (i.e. Religious) study. 6.

There were, too, certain personal historical reasons why in our quest for the discovering of all learning in all its departments, branches, sub-branches etc., in the Vedas, our gaze was riveted mainly on ethics, psychology and metaphysics on the one hand and on the \"positive\" sciences and especially mathematics on the other. 8. And the contemptuous or, at best patronising attitude adopted by some so-called Orientalists, Indologists, anti- quarians, research-scholars etc., who condemned, or light- heartedly, nay; irresponsibly, frivolously and flippantly dis- missed, several abstruse-looking and recpndite parts of the Vedas as \"sheer-nonsensem-or au \"infant-humanity's prattle\", ttnd so on, merely added fuel to the fire (so to speak) and further confirmed and strengthened our resolute determination to unravel the too-long hidden mysteries of philosophy and science contained in ancient India's Vedic lore, with the consequence that, after eigM years of concentrated eontemplation in forest- solitude, we were at long last able to recover the long lost keya which alone could unlock the portals thereof. 9. And we were agreeably astonished and intensely gra- tified to find that exceedingly tough mathematical problems (which the mathematically most advanced present day Wes- tern scientific world had spent huge lots of time, energy and money on and which even now it solves with the utmost difficulty and after vast labour involving large numbers of difficult, tedious and cumbeisome \"steps\" of working) can be easily and readily solved with the help of these ultra-easy Vedic Siitras (or mathe- matical aphorisms) contained in the Paribiata (the Appendix- portion) of the ATHARVAVEDA in a few simple steps and by mothods which can be conscientiously described as mere \"mental a~ithmetic\". 10.

And, consequently, the educationists and the cream of the English educated sect,ion of the people including the highest officials (e.g. the high-court judges, the ministers etc.,) and the general public as such were all highly impressed ; nay, thrilled, wonder-struck and flabbergasted! And not only the newspapers but even the University's official reports described the tremendous sensation caused thereby in superlati- vely eulogistic terms ; and the papers began to refer to us as \"the Octogenarian Jagadguru Shankaracharya who hat1 taken Nagpur by storm with his Vedic mathematics\", and so on ! 13.

And little children (of only 10 or 12 years of age) merely look at the sums written on the blackboard (on the platform) and immediately shout out and dictate the answers from the body of the convocation hall (or other vcnue of the demonstration).

Halstead saying \"The importance of the creation of the ZERO mark can never be exaggerated. This giving of airy nothing not merely a local habitation and a name, a picture but helpful power is the characteristic of the Hindu race whence it sprang. It is like coining the NirvBgB into dynamos. No single mathematical creation has been more potent for the general on-go of intelligence and power\".

Dutta says: \"The Hindus adopted the decimal scale vary early. The nuinerical language of no other nation is so scientific and has attained as high a state of perfection as that of the ancient Hindus. In symbolism they succeeded with ten signs to express any number most elegantly and simply. It is this beauty of the Hindu numerical notation which attrac- ted the attention of all the civilised peoples of the world and charmed them to adopt it\" (iii) In this very context, Prof. Ginsburg says:- \"The Hindu notation was carried to Arabia about. 770 A.D. by a Hindu scholar named K ~ K A who was invited from Ujjain to the famous Court of Bagh- dad by the Abbaside Khalif Al- MANS^^.

But, at the same time, we often come across special cases which, although classifiable under the general heading In question, yet present certain additional and typical charac- terestics which render them still easier to solve.

Suffice it, for our present immediate purpose, to draw the earnest attention of every scientifically-inclined mind and researchward-attuned intellect, to the remarkably extra- ordinary and characteristic-nay, unique fact that the Vedic system does not academically countenance (or actually follow) any automatical or mechanical rule even in respect of the correct sequence or order to be observed with regard to the various subjects dealt with in the various branches of Mathe- mtics (pure and applied) but leaves it entirely to the con- venience and the inclination, the option, the temperamento1 predilection and even the individual idiosynoracy of the teachere and even the students themselves (as to what particular order or sequence they should aotually adopt and follow) ! This manifestly out-of-the-common procedure must doubtless have been due to some special kind of historical back-ground, background which made such a consequence not only natural but also inevitable under the circumstances is question. Immemorial tradition has it and historical research confirms the orthodox belief that the Sages, Seers and Saints of ancient India (who are accredited with having observed, studied and meditated in the Aranya (i.e. in forest-solicitude)-on physi- cal Nature around them and deduced their grand Vedante'c Phihophy therefrom as the result not only of their theoretical reasonings but also of what may be more fittingly described as . True Realisation by means of Actual VISUALISATION) seem to have similarly observed, studied and meditated on the mysterious workings of numbers, figures etc. of the mathematical world (to wit, Nature) around them and deduced their Mathe- ntatical Philosophy therefrom by a similar process of what one may, equally correctly, describe as processes of True-Realisation by means of Actual VISUALISATION. And, consequently, it naturally follows that, in-as-much as, unlike human beings who have their own personal prejudices, partialities, hatreds and other such subjective factors distorting their visions, warping their judgements and thereby contri- buting to their inconsistent or self-contradictory decisions and discriminatory attitudes, conducts etc.), numbers (in Mathe- matics) labour under no such handicaps and disadvantages based on personal prejudices, partialities, hatreds etc. They are, on the contrary, strictly and purely impersoml and objective in their behaviour etc., follow the same rules uniformly, consis- tenly and invariatly (with", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

This seems to have been the real historical reason why. barring a few unavoidable exceptions in the shape of elementary, basic and fundamental first principles (of a preliminary or pre- requisite character), almost all the subjects dealt with in the various branches of Vedic Mathematics are explicable and expoundable on the basis of those very 'basic principles' or 'first principles', with the natural consequence that no particular subject or eubjects (or chapter or chapters) need necessarily precede or follow some other particular subject or subjects (or chapter or chapters). Nevertheless, it is also undeniable that, although any particular sequence is quite possible, permissible and feasible yet, some particular sequence will actually have to be adopted by a teacher (and, much more therefore, by an author). And 80, we find that subjects like analytical conics and even calculus (differential and integral) (which is usualIy the bugbear and terror of even the advanced students of mathematics under the present system all the world over) are found to figure and fit in at a, very early stage in our Vedic Mathematics (because of their being expounded and worked out on basic first principles. And they help thereby to facilitate mathematical study especially for the small children). And, with our more-than-half-a-century's actual personal experience of the very young mathematics-students and their difficulties, we have found the Vedic sequence of subjects and chapters the most suitable for our purpose (namely, the elimina- ting from the children's minds of all fear and hatred of mathe- matics and the implanting therein of a positive feeling of exuberant love and enjoyment thereof) ! And we fervently hope and trust that other teachers too will have a similar experience and will find us justified in our ambitious description of this volume as \"Mathematics without tears\". From the herein-above described historical back-ground to our Vedic Mathematics, it is also obvious that, being based on basic and fundamental ~rinciples, this system of mathe- matical study cannot possibly come into conflict with any other branch, department or instrument of science and eoientitlo education. In fact, this is the exact reason why all the other sciences have different Theom'es to propound but Mathematics has only THOEREMS to expound !

ACTUAE APPLICATIONS OF THE VEDIC SDTRAS TO CONCRETE MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS CHAPTER I A SPECTACULAR ILLUSTRATION For the reasons just explained immediately hereinbefore let us take the question of the CONVERSION of Vulgar fractions into their equivalent decimal form.

Explanation : The relevant Sfitra reads : $h (Eksdhikena p w e p a ) which, rendered into English, simply says : \"BY nore than the previous one\". Its application and modus operandi are as follows :- (i) The last digit of the denominator in this case being I and the previous one being 1, \"one more than the previous one\" evidently means 2. (ii) And the preposition \"by\" (in the Sfitra) indicates that the arithmetical operation prescribed is either multiplication or division. For, in the case of addition and subtraction, to and from (respectively) would have been the appropriate preposition to use. But \"by\" is the preposition actually found used in the Sfitra. The inference is therefore obvious that either multiplication or division must be enjoined. And, as both the meanings are perfectly correct and equally tenable (according to grammar and literary usage) and as there is no reason-in or from the text- for one of the meanings being accepted and the other one rejected, it further follows that both the processes are actually meant. And, as a matter of fact, each of them actually serves the purpose of the Siitra and fits right into it (as we shall presently show, in the immediately following explanation of the modus opwandi which enables us to arrlve at the right answer by either operation). A. The First method: The first method is by means of multiplication by 2 (which is the \"Ekidhika Pfirva\" i.e. the number which is just one more than the penultimate digit in this case). Here, for reasons which will become clear presently, \" . we can know beforehand that the last digif of Che answer is bound to be 1 ! For, the relevant rule hereon (which wc shall explain and dxpound", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 35, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "at a later stage) stipulates that the product of the last digit of the denomirrator and the last digit of the de~imal equivalent of the fraction in question must invariablv end in 9. Therefore, as the last digit of the denominator in this case is 9, it automabically follows that the last digit of the decimal equivalent is bound to be 1 (so that the product of the multi- plicand and the multiplier concerned may end in 9). We, therefore, start with 1 as the last (i.e. the right-hand- nio3t) digit of the answer and proceed leftward continuously multiplying by 2 (which is the EkSdhika Piirva i.e. one more than the penultimate digit of the denominator in this case) until a repetition of the whole operation stares us in the face and intimates to us that we are dealing with a Recurring Decimal and may therefore put up the usual recurring marks (dots) and stop further multiplication-work. Our modus-operandi-chart is thus as follows :- (i) We put down 1 as the right-hand most digit 1 (ii) We multiply that last digit (1) by 2 and put the 2 down as the immediately preceding digit 2 1 (iii) We multiply that 2 by 2 and put 4 down as the next previous digit 4 2 1 (iv) We multiply that 4 by 2 and put it down, thus 8 4 2 1 (v) We multiply that A by 2 and get 16 as the product. But this has two digits. We therefore put the 6 down imme- diately to the left of the 8 and keep the 1 on hand to be carried over to the left 6 8 4 2 1 at the next step (as we always do in 1 all multiplication e.g. of 69 X 2= 138 and 80 on). (vi) We now multiply the 6 by 2, get 12 as the product, add thereto the 1 (kept to be carried over from the right at the last step), get 13 as the consolidated product, put the 3 down and keep the 1 on hand for carrying over to the left at tho next step. 3 6 8 4 2 1 1 1 jvii) We then multiply the 3 by 2, add the one carried over from the right one, get 7 as the consolidated product.

We therefore put up the usual recurring marks (dots) on the &st and the last digits of the answer (for betokening that the whole of it is a Recurring Decimal) and stop the mul- tiplication there. Our chart now reads as follows :- We thus find that this answer obtained by us with the aid of our Vedic one-line mental arit,hmetic is just exactly the same as we obtained by the current method (with its 18 steps of Division-work). In passing, we may a.lso just mention that tthe current process not only takes 18 steps of working for getting the 18 digits of the answer not to talk of the time, the energy, the paper, the ink etc. consumed but also suffers under the additional and still more serious handicap that, at each step, a probable \"trial\" digit of the Quotient has to be taken on trial for multiplying the divisor which, is sometimes found to have played on us the scurvy trick of yielding a product larger than the divideadon hand and has thus-after trial-to be discarded in favour of another \"trial\" digit and so on. In the Vedic method just above propounded, however, there are no subtrac- tions at all and no need for such trials, experiments etc., and no scope for any tricks, pranks and so on but only a straightforward multiplication of single-digit numbers ; and the multiplier is not merely a simple one but also the same throughout each particular operation. All this lightens, facilitates and expedites the work and turns the study of mathematics from a burden and a bore into a thing of beauty and a joy for ever (so far, at any rate, as the children are concerned). In this context, it must also be transparently clear that the long, tedious, cumbrous and clumsy methods of the current system tend to afford greater and greater scope for the children's making of mistakes (in the course of all the long multiplications, subtractions etc. involved therein) ; and once one figure goes wrong, the rest of the work must inevitably turn out to be", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

And, as division is the exact opposite of multiplication, it stands to reason that the operation of division should proceed, not from right to left (as in the case of multi- plioation as expounded hereinbefore) but in the exactly opposite direction (i.e. from left to right). And such is actually found to be the case. Its application and modus operandi are as follows :- (i) Dividing 1 (the first digit of the dividend) by 2, we see the quotient is zero and the remainder is 1. We, therefore, set 0 down as the &st digit of the quotient and prejis the Remainder (1) to that very digit of the Quotient (as a sort of reverse-procedure to the carrying-to-the-left process used in multiplication) and thus obtain 10 as our next Dividend . 0 1 (ii) Dividing this 10 by 2, we get 6 as the second digit of the quotient ; and, as there is no remainder (to be prefixed thereto), we take up that digit 5 itself as our next Dividend. 0 5 1 (iii) So, the next quotient--digit is 2 ; and the remainder is 1. We, therefore, put 2 down as the third digit of the quotient and prefix the remainder (I) to that quotient-digit (2) and thus have 12 as our next Dividend. . 0 5 2 1 1 (iv) This gives us 6 as quotient-digit and zero as Remainder. So, we set 6 down as the fourth digit of the quotient ; and as there is no remainder to be prefixed thereto, we take the 6 itself as our next digit for division. . 0 5 2 6 3 1 1 1 1 (v) That gives us 1 and 1 as Quotient and Remainder respectively. We therefore put 1 down as the 5th quotient-digit, prefix the 1 thereto and have 11 as our next Dividend. 0 5 2 6 3 1 5 1 1 1 1 (vi-xvii) Carrying this process of straight, continuous division by 2, we get 2 as the 17th quotient-digit and 0 as remainder.

This method holds good in all cases and is, therefore, capable of infinite application. In fact, old historical traditions describe this cross-subtraction process as having been res- ponsible for the acceptance of the x mark as the sign of multiplication.

The algebraical explanation for this is very simple :- (x-a) (x-b) = x (x-a-b)+ab. A slight difference, however, is noticeable when the vertical multiplication of the deficit digits (for obtaining the right-hand-side portion of the answer) yields a product con- sisting of more than one digit. For example, if and when we have to multiply 6 by 7, and write it down as usual :- 7-3 6-4 3/12 we notice that the required vertical multiplication (of 3 and 4) gives us the product 12 (which consists of 2 dlgits; but, as our base is 10 and the right-hand-most digit is obviously of units, we are entitled only to one digit (on the right-hand side). This difficulty, however, is easily surmounted with the usual multiplicational rule that the surplus portion on the left should always be \"carried\" over to the left. Therefore, in the present case, we keep the 2 of the 12 on tjhe right hand side and \"cairy\" the 1 over to the left and change the 3 into 4.

We should therefore adopt the same method as before (i.e. keep the *errnissible two digits on the right-hand side and \"carry\" the surplus or extra digit over to the left) (as in the case of ordinary addition, compound addition etc.) Thus- 88-12 88-12 25-75 88-12 91- 9 98- 2 ..................... 76/,44=77/44 79/,08=80/08 23/,50-24/50 --------- Note :-Also, how the meaning of the Slitra comes out in all the exaruples just above dealt with and tells us how to write down immediately the deficit figures on the side. The rule is that 2111 the other digits (of the given original nunlbers) are to be subtracted from 9 but the last (i.e. the right hand-rr~ost one) 3 should be deducted from 10. Thus, if 63 be the given number, the deficit (from the base)' is 37 ; and so on. This process helps us in the work of ready on-sight subtraction and enables us to put the deficiency down immediately. A new point has now to be taken into consideration i.e. that, just as the process of Gertical muftiplication may yield a larger number of digits in the product than is permissible (and this contingency has been provided for), so, it may similarly yield a product consisting of a smaller number of digits than we are entitled to.

Thc needed solution for this purpose is furnished by a small 'Upaslitra' (or sub-formula) which is so-called because of its practically axiomatic character. This sub-shtra consists of only one word (Anurtpyena) which simply means \"Proportionately\". In actual application, it connotes that, in,all cases where there is a rational ratio-wise relationship, the ratio should be taken into account and should lead to a proportionate multiplication or division as the case may be. In other words, when neither the multiplicand nor the multiplier is bufficiently near a convenient power of 10 (which can suitably serve us as a base), we can take a convenient mul- tiple or sub-multiple of a suitable base, as our \"Working Base\", perform the necessary operation with its aid and then multiply or divide the result proportionately (i.e. in the same proportion as the original base may bear to the working base actually used by us). A concrete illustration will make the modus operandi clear. Suppose we have to multiply 41 by 41. Both these numbers are so far away from the base 100 that by our adopting that as our actual base, we shall get 59 and 59 as the deficiency from the base.

But before we actually take up the 'Ordhva-Tir~aF formula and explain its modus oparandi for multiplication, we shall just now explain a few corollaxies which arise out of the 'Nikhilah' Siitra which is the subject-matter of this chapter. The Pirst Corollary : The first corollary naturally arising out of the 'Nikhi1a7n1 Siitra reads as follows :- 5 - * M. II which means :-\"whatever the extent of its deficiency, lessen it still further to that very extent ; and also set up the square (of that deficiency)\". This evidently deals with tho squaring of numbers. A few elementary examples will suffice to make its meaning and application clear :- Suppose we have to find the square of 9. The following will be the successive stages in our (mental) working :- (i) We should take up the nearest power of 10 (i. e. 10 itself) as our base. (ii) As 9 is 1 less than 10, we should decrease it still further by 1 and sct it (the 8) down as our left-side portion of the answer. 81 (iii) And, on the right hand, we put down the square of that deficiency (la) 811 (iv) Thus Q4=81 9-1 9-1 - 8 1 1 - Now, let us take up the case of 88 AS 8 is 2 less than lo, we lessen it still further by 2 and get 8-2 (i. e. 6) for the 6/ left-hand and putting 22 (=4) on the 614 8-2 right-hand side, we say 8%=64 8-2 - In", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

We work exactly as before ; but, instead of reducing still further by the deficit, we increase the number still further by the surplus and say :- 112=(11+1) /12=12/1 11+1 11+1 la2=(12+2) /2'=14/4 12 / 1 - 132=(13+3) /3'=16/9 142=(14+4) /42=18/16=19/6 1b2=(15+5) /52=20/25=225 10+9 19+9 192=(19+9) /g2=28/,1=361 ; and so on. 28/,1=361.

Thus, if 97 has to be squared, we should select such a number (b) as will, by addition or by subtraction, give us a number ending in a zero (or zeros) and thereby lightcn the multi-multiplication work. In the present case, if our (b) be 3, a+b will become 100 and a-b will become 94. Their product is 9400 ; and bZ=9 :.972=94/09. This proves the Corollary. Similarly, 92a=(92+ 8) (92-8)f 64=84/64 ; 93'=(93+7) (93-7)$-49=86/49 ; 9882=(988+12) (988-12)+144-=976/144 ; 1082=(108+8) (108-8)+ 64=116/64 ; aqd so on. The Third Algebraieal Explanation is based on the Nikhilavi Sctra and has been indicated already. The following additional sample-exalnples will further serve to enlighten the student (on this Corollary) :- (1) 1g2 OR (2) 1gZ (3) 2g2 19+9 19-1 29+9 19+9 19-1 --- --- 29+9 --- 28/81 181 1 --- 38 181 x 2 x 2 =36 / 1 --- --- =36 / 1 =84 / 1 Note :--All the cases dealt with hereinabove are doubtless of numbers just a little below or just a little above a power of ten or of a multiple or sub-multiple thereof.

{"chunk_id": 51, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "the Ordhva-15iryak Sntra) ; and still most \"difficult\" will be explained in a still later chapter (dealing with the squaring, cubing etc., of bigger numbers). The Second Cwollary. The second corollary is applicable only to a special case under the first corollary (i. e. the squaring of numbers ending in 6 and other cognate numbers). Its wording is exactly the same as that of the Sfitra which we used at the outset for the conversion of vulgar fractions into their recurring decimal equivalents (i. e. @). The Siitra now takes a totally different meaning altogether and, in fact, relates to a wholly different set-up and context altogether. 8 I ( 34 1 Its literal meaning is the same as before (i. e. \"by one more than the previous one\") ; but it now relates to the squaring of numbers ending in 5 (e. g. say, 15). 11 5 Here, the last digit is 5 ; and the \"previous\" one -- is 1. 80, one more than that is 2. Now, the Sfitra 2/25 in this context tells us to multiply the previous - i &it (1) by one more than itself (i. by 2), So the left-hand side digit is 1 x 2 ; and the right-hand ade is the vertical-multiplication-product (i. e. 86) as usual. 'thus 15'=1 X 2/25=2/25. Similarly, 2 5 ' = 2 ~ 3/25=6/25 ; 352=3~4/25=12/25 ; 4 5 * = 4 ~ 5/25=20/25 ; 55'=5 X 6/25=30/25 ; 65a=6 x 7/25=42/25 ; 75a=7 ,: 8/25=56/25 ; 852=8X 9/25=72/25 ; 952=9 X 10/25=90/25 ; 1052=10~ 11/25=110/25 ; 1152=11 X 12/25=132/25 ; 1252=156/25 ; 135'=182/25 ; 1458=210/25 ; 1552=240/25 ; 16ba=272/25 ; 1752=306/% ; 185'=342/25 ; 195'=380/25 ; and so on. The Algebraical Explamtion is quite simple and follows straight-away from the Nikhilad Sara and still more so from the Ordhva-Tiyak formula to be explained in the next chapter (q.v.). A sub-corollary to this Corollay (relating to the squaring of numbers ending in 5) reads : awmX+fi (Antyayw- Daiake'pi) and tells us that the above rule is applicable riot only to the squaring of a number ending in 5 but also to the multiplication of two numbers whose last digits together total 10 and whose previous part is exactly the same. For example, if the numbers to be multiplied are not 25 and 25, but, say 27 and 23 [whose last digits i.e. 7 & 3 together", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

Andso27~23=6/21. 27 23 - =6/2l -- We can proceed further on the same lines and say :- 9 6 ~ 94=90/24 ; 97X93=90/21 ; 9 8 ~ 92=90/16 ; 99~91=90/09 ; 37X33=12/21 ; 79~71=56/09 ; 87~83=72/21 ; 114x116=132/24 ; and so on This sub-corollary too is based on the same Nikhilam Sfitra ; and harder examples thereof will more appropriately come under the Ordhva-Tiryak formula of the next chapter (or the still later chapter on more difficult squarings and cubings). At this point, however, it may just be polnted out that the above rulc is capable of further application and come in handy, for the multiplication of numbers whose last digits (in sets of 2,3 and so on) together total 100, 1000 etc. For example- 191 x 109=20/819 7 9 3 ~ 707=560/651 884 X 816=720/,344=721/344. N . B.--Note the added zero at the end of the left-hand-side of the answer. The Third Corollary : Then comes a Third Corollary to the Nikhila* Sfitra, which relates to a very special type of multiplication and which is not frequently in renuisition elsewhere but is often required in mathematical astronomy etc. The wording of the sub- stbra (corollary) y e $JI (Ekanyanena Piirvm) sounds as if it were the converse of the Ekidhika Sfitra . It actually is ; and it relates to and provides foi. multiplications wherein the multiplier-digits consist entirely of nines. It comes up under three different headings as follows :- The F'irst case . The annexed table of products produced by the single- digit multiplier 9 gives us the necessary clue to an under- standing of the Sttra :- / I We observe that the left-hand-side is invariably 1 one less than the multiplicand and that the g X 2=1 1 I right-sidedigit is merely the complement of the :,\" 1 1 left-handside d i ~ i t from 9.

As regards multiplicands and multipliers of 2 digits each, we have the following table of products :- 11 X99=10 89 =(11-1)/99-(11-1)=1089 12X99=ll 88 13X99=12 87 14X99=13 86 15X99=14 85 16X99=15 84 17X99=16 83 18X99=17 82 lOX99=18 81 20X99=19 80 And this table shows that the rule holds good here too. And by similar continued observation, we find that it is uniformly applicable to all cases, where the multiplicand and the multiplier consist of the same number of digits. In fact, it is a simple application of the Nikhilah Stitra and is bound to apply. 7- 3 77- 23 979-021 9- 1 1 99- 1 1 999- 1 1 6 13 76 / 23 978 / 021 We are thus enabled to apply the rule to all such cases and say, for example :- 1203579 9999999 -- Such multiplications (involving multipliers of this special type) come up in advanced astronomy etc ; and this sub- formula (EkanyCnem Ptirveva) is of immense utility therein. The Second Case : The second case falling under this category is one wherein the multiplicand consists of a smaller number of digits than the mulbiplier. This, however, is easy enough to handle ; and all that is necessarv is to fill the blank (on the left) in with the required number of zeroes and proceed exactly as before and then leave the zeroes out. Thus- 7 79 - --_- ______---- The Third Case : (To be omitted during a first reading) . The third case coming under this heading is one where 1 the multiplier contains a smaller number of digits than the I multiplicand.

This gives us the left-hand-side portion of the product.

The applications of this brief and terse SCltra are nlarlifola (as will be seen again and again, later on). First we take it up in its most elementary application (namely, to Multi- plication in general). A silnple example will suffice to clarify the modus operandi thereof. Suppose we have to multiply 12 by 13. (i) We multiply the left-hand-most 12 digit (1) of the multiplicand verti- 13 cally by the left-hand-most digit -- (1) of the multiplier, get their i : 3+2 : 6=166 product (1) and set it down as the -- left-hand-most part of the answer.

Thus l2X13=166.

The digits carried over may be shown in the working (as illustrated below) :- The Algebraical ptinciple involved is as follows :- Suppose we have to multiply (ax+b) by (cx+d). The product is acxa+x (ad+bc)+bd. In other words, the first term (i. e. the coefficient of xy is got by vertical multiplication of a and c ; the middle term (i. e. the coefficient of x) is obtained by the cross-wise multiplication of a and d and of b and e and the addition of the two products ; and the independent term is arrived at by vertical multiplication of the absolute", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 56, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "terms. And, as all arithmetical numbers are merely algebraic expres- ( 42 ) sions in x (with ~ = 1 0 ) , the algebraic principle explained above is readily applicable to arithmetical numbers too. Now, if our multiplicand and multiplier be of 3 digits each, it merely means that we are multiplying (axa+bx+c) by (dxa+ex+f) (where x=10) :- axa+bx+c dxa+ex+f adx4+x3 (ae+bd)+xa (af+be+cd)+x (bf+ce)+cf We observe here the following facts :- (i) that the coefficient of x4 is got by the vertical multi- plication of the first digit (from the left side) ; (ii) that the coefficient of x3is got by the cross-wise multiplication of the first two digits and by the addition of the two products ; (iii) that the coefficient of xa is obtained by the multi- plication of the first digit of the multiplicand by the last digit of the multiplier, of the middle one by the middle one and of the last one by the first one and by the addition of all the 3 products ; (iv) that the coefficient of x is' obtained by the cross- wise multiplication of the second digit by the third one and conversely and by the addition of the two products ; and (v) that the independent term results from the vertical multiplication of the last digit by the last digit.

Having dealt with Multiplication at fairly considerable length, we now go on to Division ; and there we start with the Nikhikcm method (which is a special one). Suppose we have to divide a number of dividends (pf two digits each) successively by the same Divisor 9 we make a chart therefor as follows :- Let us first split each dividend into a left-hand part for the Quotient and a right-hand part for the Remainder and divide them by a vertical line. In all these particular cases, we observe that the fist d@t of the Dividend becomes the Quotient and the sum of the two digits becomes the Remainder.

Next, we take as Dividends, another set of bigger num- bers of 3 digits each and make a chart of them as follows :- In these cases, we note that the Remainder and the sum of the digits are still the same and that, by taking the Grst digit of the Dividend down meohanically and adding it to the second digit of the dividend, we get the second digit of the quotient and that by adding it to the third digit of the dividend, we obtain the remainder. And then, by extending this procedure to still bigger numbers (consisting of still more digits), we are able to get the quotient and remainder correctly. For example, (1) 9 ) 120311 (2) 9 ) 123011 (3) 9) 120021/2 13316 13616 1333516 --- 133617 136617 13335618 And, thereafter, we takeafew more oases as follows :- 25/12 But in all these cases, we find that the Remainder is the same as or greater than the Divisor. As this is not permissible, we re-divide the Remainder by 9, carry the quotient over to the Quotient column and rctain the final Remainder in the Remainder clouma, as follows :- We also notice that, when the Remainder is greater than the Divisor, we can do the consequent final Division by the same method, as follows :- (1) 9) 1316 114 14/l/O 11 111 -- 151 1 We next take up the next lower numbers (8,7 etc.) as our Divisors and note the results, as follows :- Here we observe that, on taking the first digit of the Dividend down mechanically, we do not get the Remainder by adding that digit of the quotient to the second digit of the dividend but have to add to it twice. thrice or 4 times the quotient- digit already taken down. In other words, we have to multiply the quotient-d+jt by 2 in the case of 8, by 3 in the case of 7, by 4 in the case of 6 and so on. And this again means that we have to multiply the quotient-digit by the Divisor's comple- ment from 10. And this suggests that the NikhiZa?h rule (about the sub- traction of all from 9 and of the last from 10) is at work ; and, to make sure of it, we try with bigger divisions, as follows:", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 63, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "In all the above examples, we have deliberately taken as Divisiors, numbers containing big digits. The reason therefor is as follows :- (i) It is in such division (by big divisions) that the student b d s his chief difficulty, because he has to multiply long big numbers by the \"trial\" digit of the quotient at every step and subtract that result from each dividend at each step ; but, in our method (of the Ndkhilam formula), the bigger the digits, the smaller will be the required complement (from 9 or 10 as the case may be) ; and the multiplication- task is lightened thereby. (ii) There is no subtraction to be done at all 1 (iii) And, even as regards the multiplication, we have no multiplication of numbers by numbers as such but only of a single digit by a single digit, with the pleasant consequence that, at no stage, is a student called upon to multiply more than 9 by more than 9. In other words, 9x9=81, ie the utmost multi- plication he has to perform. A single sample example will suffice to prove this : (24) 9819) 2 01 37 02162 Note :-In this case, the product of 8 and 9 is written down in its proper-plaoe, as 16 (with no ''oarryhg\" over to the left) and so on.

In fact, we have accomplished our division-work in full, without I actually doing any division at all ! As for divisors consisting of small digits, another simple formula will serve our purpose and is to be dealt with in the next chapter. Just at present (in this chapter), we deal only with big divisors and explain how simple and easy such difficult multiplications can be made (with the aid of the Nikhilam Sfha). And herein, we take up a few more illustrative examples relating to the cases (already referred to) wherein the Remainder exceeds the Divisor and explain the process, by which this difficulty can be easily surmounted (by further application of the same Nikhilam method) :- The Remainder here (110) being greater than the Divisor (88) we have to divide 110 by 88 and get the quotient and the final", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

Yea ; this is all good enough so far as it go&; but it provides only for a particular type (namely, of divisions in- volving large-digit numbers). Can it help us in other divisions (i.e. those which involve small-digit divisors) ?

And this is found provided for in the Paraivartya Sara, which is a special- case formula, which reads \"Paraivartya Yojuyet\" and which means \"Transpose and apply\". The well-known rule relating to transposition enjoins invariable change of sign with every change of side. Thus+ becomes-and conversely ; and x becomes + and conversely. In the current system, this law is known but only in its application to the transposition of terms from left to right and conversely and from numerator to denominator and conversely (in connection with the solution of equations, the proving of Identities etc., etc ; and also with regard to the Remainder Theorem, Horner's process of Synthetic Division etc. etc.) According to the Vedic system, however, it has a number of applications, one of which is discussed in the present chapter. At this point, we may make a reference to the Remainder Theorem and Hornefs process and then pass on to the other most interesting applications of the Parcivartya Sara. The Remainder Theorem : We m y begin this part of this exposition with a simple proof of the Remainder Theorem, as follows: If E, D, Q & R be the Dividend, the Divisor, the Quotient and the Remainder in a case of division and if the divisor is (x-p), we may put this relationship down algebraically as follows :- E-D Q+R i.e. E=Q (x-p)+R. And if we put x=p, x-p becomes zero; and the Identity takes the shape, E=R. In other words, the given expression E itself (with p substituted for x) will be the Remainder. Thus, the given expression E (i.e. the Dividend itself) (with p substituted for x) automaticaily becomes the remainder. And p is automatically available by putting x-p=O i.e. by merely reversing the sign of the-p (which is the absolute term in the binomial divisor). In general terms, this means that, if c be a ~ ~ + b x \" - ~ + c x \" - ~ + d x ~ ~ etc. and if D be X-p, the remainder is ap\"+bpn\"+cpn-2+dpeS and so on (i.e. E with p substituted for x). This is the Remainder Theorem. Horner's process of Synthetic Division carries this still further and tells us the quotient too. It is, however, only a very small part of the Parcivartya formula (which goes much farther and is capable of numerous applications in other directions also).

Dividend and so on), (ii) the subtraction of large numbers from large numbers, (iii) the length, cumbrousness, clumsiness etc, of the whole procedure, (iv) the consequent liability of the student to get disgusted with and sick of it all, (v) the resultant greater risk of errors being committed and so on ; (2) And yet, although comparatively superior to the process now in vogue everywhere, yet, they too suffer, in some mses, from these disadvantages. At any rate, they do not, in such cases, conform to the Vedic system's Ideal of \"Short and Sweet\" ; (3) And, besides, all the three of them are suitable only for some special and particular type (or types) of cases ; and none of them is suitable for general application to all cases :- (i) The 'Nikhilam' method is generally unsnitable for Algebraic divisions ; and almost invariably, the 'Parci- vartya' process suits them better ; (ii) and, even as regards Arithmetical con~putations, the 'Nikhila~' method is serviceable only when the Divisor-digits are large numbers (i.e., 6, 7, 8 or 9) and not at a11 helpful when the divisor digits are small ones (i.e. 1, 2, 3. 4 and 5) ; and it is only the 'Parcivartya' method that can be applied in the latter kind of cases !

All these considerations (arising from our detailed- comparative-study of a large number of examples) add up, in effect, to the simple conclusion that none of these methods car1 be of general utility in all cases, that the selection of the most suitable method in each particular case may (owing to want of uniformity) be confusing to the student and that this element of uncertainty is bound to cause confusion. And the question therefore naturally-my, unavoidably arises as to whether the Vedic SGtras can give 11s a General Formula applicable to all cases. And the answer is :-Yes, most certainly YES ! There is a splendid and beautiful and very easy method which conforms with the Vedic ideal of ideal simplicity all-round and whirh in fact gives us what we have been describing as \"Vedic one line- mental answers\" !

FACTORISATION (of Simple Quadratics) Facttarisation wmes in naturally at this point, as a form of whst we have called \"Reversed multiplication\" and as a particular application of division. There is a lot of strikingly good material in the Vedic Siitras on this subject too, which is new to the modern mathematical world but which comes in at a very early stage in our Vedic 'Mathematics. We do not, however, propose to go into a detailed and exhaustive exposition of the subject but shall content ourselves with a few simple sample examples which will serve to throw light thereon and especially on the Sfitraic technique by which a Siitra consisting of only one or two simple words, makes comprehensive provision for explaining and elucidating a pro- cedure yhereby a 80-called \"difficult\" mathematical problem (which, in the other system puzzles", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

For instance, let us take the question of factorisation of a quadratic expression ints its component binomial factors. I When the coefficient of xa is 1, it is easy enough, even according 1 to the current system wherein you are asked to think out and find two numbers whose algebraic total is the middle coeffi- cient and whose product is the absolute term. For example, let thc quadratic expression in question be x2+7x+10, we mentally do the lllultiplication of the two factors ,+2 (xf2) and (x+5) whore product is xa+7x+10 ; x+5 nd (by a mental procpss of reverting thereof), <2+7x+10 we think of 2 and 5 whose sum is 7 and whose -------- product is 10: and we thus factorise (x2+7x+10) into (x+2) and (x+5 . And the actual working out thereof is as follows :- x2+7x+10 =x2+2x+5x+10 =x(x f 2)+5 ( ~ $ 2 ) The procedure is, no doubt, mathematically correct; but the process ie needlessly long and cumbrous. However, as the mental process actually employed is as explained above, there is no great harm done. In respect, however, of Quadratic expressions whose fist coefficient is not unity (e.g. 2x2+5x+2), the students do not follow the mental process in question but helplessly depend on the 4-step mcthod shown above and work it out as follows: - 2x2+5x+2 =2xa+4x+x+2 =2x(x+2)+1 (xf2) =(x+2) (2xSl) As the pupils are never taught to apply the mental process which can give us this result immediately, it means a real injury. The Vedic system, however, prevcnts this kind of harm, with the aid of two small sub-Siitras which say (i) v h (Anurfipyena) and (i) amrq&,~+,~& (Adyamcidyencintya- nacsntyelaa) and which mean 'proportionately' and 'the first by the first and the last by the last'. The former has been explained already (in connection with the use of multiples and sub-multiples, in multlpllcation and division) ; but, alongside of the latter sub-Siitra, ~t acquires a new and beautiful double application and significance and works out as follows :- (i) Split the middle coefficient into two such parts that the ratio of the first coefficient to that first part is the same as the ratio of that second part to the last coefficient.

Now, this ratio (i.e. ~ $ 2 ) is one factor. And the second factor is obtained by dividing the first coefficient of the Quadratic by the first coefficient of the factor ( 88 ) already found and the last coeffic~ent of the Quadratic by the last coefficient of that factor. In other words the second Binomial 2x2 2 faebor is obtained thus: -+- - 2x+1. x 2 - Thus we say : 2x2+5x+2=(x+2) (2x+1). Note :-The middle coefficient (which we split-up above into (4+1) may also be split up into (i+4), that the ratio in that case is (2x+l) and that the othcr Binomial factor (according to the abo-e-explained method) is (x+2). Thus, the change of SEQUENCE (in thc splitting up of the middle term) makos no difference to the factors themselves ! This sub-Stitra has actually been used already (in the chapters on dixision) ; and it will be coming up again and again, later on .(i.e. in Co-ordinate Geometry etc., in connection with straight lines, Hyperbolas, Conjugate Hyperbolas, Asymp- totes etc.) But, just now, we make use of it in connection with the factorisation of Quadratics into their Binomial factors. The following additional examples will be found useful :- An additional sub-sfitra is of immense ultility in this context, for the purpose of vmifying the correctness of our answers in multiplications, divisions and factorisations.

CHAPTER VIII FACTORISBTlON (of \"Harder\" Quadratics) There is a class of Quadratic expressions known as Homogeneous Expressions of the second degree, wherein several letters (x, y, z etc.) figure andwhich are generally fought shy of by students (and teachers too) as being too \"difficult\" but which can be very easily tackled by means of the Adyamci- dyena Sctra (just explained) and another sub-Siitra whicl~ consists of only one (compound) word, which reads =rsr and means :-\"by (alternate) Elimination and Retention\" Suppose we have to factorise the Homogeneous quadratic (2xa+6ya+3z2+7xy+llyz+7zx). This is obviously a case in which the ratios of the coefficients of the various powels of the various letters are difficult to find out ; and the reluctance of students (and even of teachers) to go into a troublesome thing like this, is quite understandable. The 'Lopam-Sthipam' sub-Siitra, however, removes the whole difficulty and makes thc factorisat~on of a Quadratic of this type as easy and simple as that of the ordlnary quadratic (already explaiced). The procedure is as follows :- Suppose we have to factorise the following long Quadratic : 2x~+6y~+3z~+7xy+llyz+7zx. (i) We first eliminate z (by putting z=0) and retain only x and y and factorise the resulting ordinary quadratic (in x and y) (with the Adyam Sfitra) ; (ii) We then similarly eliminate y and retain only x and a and factorise the simple quadratic (in x and z) ; (iii) with these two sets of factors before us, we fill in the gaps caused bv our own deliberate elimination of z and y respectively. And that gives us the real factors of the given long expression. The procedure is an argumentative one and is as follows :-- If e=O, then E (the given expression)=2xa+7xy+6y2 =(x+2yl (2x+3y). Similarly, if y=o, then E=2xa+7xy+-~z~(x+~z)(~x+z) :. Filling in the gaps which we ourselves had created by leaving out z and y, we say : E=(x+2y+3z) (2x+3y+z) The following additional examples will be found useful :- (1) 3xZ+y~-2za--4xy+y~-zx E=jx-y) (3x-y) and also (x-z) (3x+2z) :. E=(x-y- z) (3x-y+2z) (2) 3xa+xy -2ya+19xz+ 28z2+9xy-30wa-yz+19wy +46zw. By eliminating two letters at a time, we get : E=(x+y) (3x-2y), (3x+4z) (~$72) and also (x-2y) (3x+15w) :. E=(x+y+4z-2w) (3~-2y+4z+15w) (3) 2x2+2y\"5xy+2x-5y-12L(xS3) (ax-4) and also ( 2 ~ + 3 ) (y-4) :. E=(x+zp+3)", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

That would not, however, have given us any additional meterla1 but' would have only confir- med and verified the answer we had already obtained.

The following exceptions to t h ~ s rule should be noted :- (1) x%+xy-2y2+2xz-5yz-3z2 =(x-y) (x+2y) and (x-z) (~$32) ( 92 But x is to be found in all the terms ; and there is no means for deciding the proper combinations. In this case, therefore, x too may be eliminated ; and y and z retained. By so doing, we have :- E= -2y2-5~~-3~2=(-y-z)(2y+3~) :. E=(x-y-z) (x+Zy+3z). OB, avoid the xP (which gives the same co-efficient) and take only ye or z2. And then, the confusion caused by the oneness of the coefficient (in all the 4 factors) is avoided ; and we get, E=(x-y-z) (x+2y+3z) (as before). (2) xa+2yz+3xy+2xz+3yz+z2. (i) By eliminating z, y and x one after another, we have E=(x+y+z) (x+ay+z) OR (11) By y or z both times, we get the same answer.

{"chunk_id": 79, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "both the Quotient and the Remainder can be easily found by one or other method of division explained already. From this it follows that, if, in this process, the remainder is found to be zero, it means that the given dividend is divisible by the given divisor, i.e. the divisor is a factor of the Dividend. And this means that, if, by some such method, we are able to find out a certain factor of a given expression, the remaining factor (or the product of a11 the remaining factors) can be obtained by simile division of the expression in question by the factor already found out by some method of division. (In this context, the student need hardly be reminded that, in all Algebraic divisions, the 'Pardvartya' method is always to be preferred to the 'Nzkhilam' method). Applying this prinripIe to the case of a cubic, we may say that, if, by the Remainder Theorem or otherwise, we know onc Binomial factor of a cubic, simple division by that factor will suffice to enabIe us to find out the Quadratic (wliich is the product of the remaining two binomial factors). And these two can be obtained by the 'Adyamddyena' method of factorisation already explained. A simpler and easier device for performing this operation will be to write down the first and the last terms by the 'Adyarni- dyena' method and the middle term with the aid of the Gupita- Samuccaya rule (i.e. the principle-already explained with regard to the So of the product being the same as the Product of the So of the factors). Let us take a concrete example and see how this method can be made use of. Suppose we have to factorise xS+6x2+ llx+6 and that, by some method, we know (x+l) to be a factor. We first use the Adyamdyena formula and thus mechanically put down x2 and 6 as the first and the last coeffi- cients in the quotient (i.e. the product of the remaining two binomial factors). But we know alreddy that the So of the given expression is 24 ; and, as the So of (x-l)=2 we therefore know that the So of the quotient must ba 12. And as the fist and last digits thereof are already known to be I and 6, their total is 7. And therefore the middle term must be 12-7=5. So, the quotient is xz+5x+6.

The student will remember that the ordinary rule for divisibility of a dividend by a divisor (as has been explained already in the section dealing with the \"Remainder-Theorem\") is as follows :- If E=DQ+R, if D=x-p and if x=p, then E=R. COROLLARIES (i) So, if, in the dividend, we substitute 1 for x, the result will be that, as all the powers of 1 are unity itself, thc dividend will now consist of the sum of all the coefficients. Thus, if D is x-1, R=a+b+c+d+(where a, b, c, d etc., are the successive coefficients) ; and then, if a+b+c etc.,=o, it will mean that a8 R=O, E is divisible by D. In other words, x-1 is a factor. (ii) If, however, D=x+l and if we substitute -1 for x in E, then, inasmuch as the odd powers of -1 will all be -1 and the even powers thereof will all be 1, therefore it will follow that, in this case, R=a-b+c-d etc. So, if R=o i.e. if a-bfc-d etc., =0, i.e. if a-b+c-d etc., 20, i.8. a+c+ ... =b+d+ .... i.e. if the sum of the coefficients of the odd powers of x and the sum of the coefficients of the even powers be equal, then x+l will be a factor. The following few illustrations will elucidate the actual application of the principle mainly by what may be called the Argumentation method, based on the simple multiplication- formula to the effect that- (x+a) (x+b) ( x + ~ ) = x ~ + x ~ (a+b+c)+x(ab+ac+b~) +abc, as follow8 :- (1) Factorise x8+6xa+11xf 6.

E=(x+l) ( ~ $ 2 ) (x+3). or (ii) So (the sum of the coefficients of the odd powers) =1+11=12 ; and Se (the sum of the coefficients of the even powers)=6$6=12. And as So=S, :. x+l is a factor. :.

SIMPLE EQUATIONS (FIRST PRINCIPLES) As regards the solution of equations of various types, the Vedic sub-SCitras give us some First Principles which are theoretically not unknown to the western world but are not (in actual practice) utilised as basic and fundamental first principles of a practically Axiomatic character (in mathe- matical computations). In order to solve such equations, the students do not generally use these basic sub-SCtras as such but (almost invari- ably) go through the whole tedious work of practically proving the formula in question instead of taking it for granted and applying it ! Just as if on every occasion when the expression a8+b3-+c3-3abc. comes up ; one should not take it for granted that its factors are (a+b+c) and (aa+b8+ca-ab-bc-ca) but should go through the long process of multiplying these two, showing the product and then applying it to the case on hand, similarly for Pythagoras Theorem etc. !

The second common type is one in which each side (t,he L.FI.S. and the R.H.8.) contains two Rinomia,l factors. - In general terms, let (x+a) (x$b)=(x+c) (x+d).

This is simple enough and easy enough for m+n the student to assimildte ; and it should be assimilated and readily applied mentally to any case before us. In fact, the application of this Iwocess may, in clue course, Ily means of practice, be extended so as to cover carjes involvil~~ i~ larger number of ternis. For instance, ' n - + L + - P - =o x+a x+b x+n :. m[x~+x(b+c)+bc]+n[x2+x(c~-a)+ca]$ -+-p[x2 +x(a+b)+ab] =0 :. x2(m+n+p)+x[rn(b+o)+n(c+a)+p(a+b)]-t (mbofnca +pab)=0 If m+n+p=O, then Rut if m+n+pf 0, then it will bc a Quadratic equat~on and will have to be solved as such (as explained in a later chapter). And this nlethod can bt: exterlded to any numbcr of tcrrus (on the same lines as explained above). LINKING NOTE Special Types of Bpuationx The above types niay be described as General types. But there are, as in the cave of mulltiplications, divisions etc,, particular types which possess certain specific characteristics of a SPECIAL character which can be more easily tackled (than the ordinary ones) with the aid of certain very short SPECIAL processes what one may describe as mental one-linc methods). As already explained in a pevious context, all that the student has to do is to look for certain characteristics. spot them out, identify the particular type and apply the formula which is applicable thereto. These SPECIAL types of equations, we now go on to, in the next few chapters. STMPLE EQUATIONS (by S c t ~ a Szinyuqn etc.,) We begih this section with an exposition of several special types of ~quat~ions which can be solved practically at sight- with t,he aid of a beautiful special Siitra which reads : ?@ ('8.linyam S6~riyasamucw.ye') a.nd which, in cryptic language (which renders it applicable to a large number of differelit eases) merely says : ' when the Samuccaya is the same, that Sum~tccaya is zero\" i.e. it should be equxted to zero. 'Sun~uccayu' is a technical term which has several mean- ings (under different contexts) ; and we shdl explain them, one by one : FIRST MEANINC AND APPLICATION 'Xamuccaya' first nicans a tern1 which", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

Bx=O :. r = O A11 these detailed steps are unnecessary; and, in fact,, ?to one works it out in this way. The mere fact t,hat x occurs as a common factor in all the tenns on both sides [or on tbe L.H.S. (wit,h zero on the R.H.S.)] is sufficient for the inference that x is zero ; and no inter~nediate step i~ necessary for arriving at this concluruon. This is practically axiomatic. And this is applicable not only to x or other such \"unknown quantity\" but to every such case. Thus, if 9 (x+1)=7(~+1), we need not say: R(x+l)=7(x+ 1) :. 9x3-9=7~+7 :. 9 ~ - 7 ~ = 7 - 9 ... sx=--e :. x=-1. On the contrary, we can straightaway say : 9(~+1)=7(~+1) :. x+1=0 :. x=-1 SECOND MEANING AND APPLICATION The word 'Samuccaya' has, as its second meaning, the product of the independent terms. Thus, (x+7)(x+O)=(x+3) (x+21) :. Here 7 x 9=3 it 21. Therefore x=O.

Thus : This is the current method. But the \"Stinyam Srirnya- Samuccaye\" formula tells us that, inasmuch as N,+N2=4x+16 and Dl+D, is also 4x+l6 :. 4x+16=0 :. x=-4. In fact, as soon as this eharacteriat~c is noted and the type rccogn~sed, the student can at once mentally say : x=-4. Note: -IF in the algebraical total, there bc a nnmerical favtor that sllould be romovcd. Thus: 3x4 4- x+1 6 5 7 -2xfy Here N,+N, = 4x+5 ; and Dl+D2 = 8x+lO.

PIPTH MEANING AND APPLICATION (for Quadratics) With the same meaning (i.e. total) of the word % + 'Samuccaya', t,here is a fifth kind of application possible or this Sfitra. And this has to do with Quadratic equations. None need, however, go into a panic over this. It is as simple and as easy as the fourth application : and even little children can understand and readiiy apply this Sttra in this context, as explained below. In thc two instances given above, it will be observcd that the cross-multiplications of the coeficients of x gives us the same coefficient for x2. In the first case, we had 4xa on both sides ; and in the second example, it was 6x2 on both sides. The two cancelling out, we had simple eq~iations to deal wit,h. But there are other cases where the coefficients of x2 are not the same on the two sides ; ancl this means that we have a cl~~adratic equation before us. But it does not matter. For, the same Sfitra applies (alt,llougll in a different direction) here too a.nd gives us also the second root of the quadratic equation. The only difference is that inasmuch as Algebraic: 'Sa,vr~uccaya' includes sub- traction too, we therefore now take into account, not only the sum of N, and N2 and the sum of Dl and D, but also the differences between the numerator and the denominator on each side ; and, if they be equal, we at once eqnate that difference to Zr~o. Let us take a concrete exanlplc and suppose we have to 3x+4 - 5x+6 solve the equation - -- ----- Gx+7 2x+3 (i) We note that Nl+N,=8x+10 and Dl+D, is also 8x+10; we therefore use the method described in the fourth application given above and equate 8x3- 10 to zero and say : x=-514. (ii) But lnelital cross-multiplication reveals that the x2 coefficients (on the L.H.S. and the R.H.S.) are 6 and 30 respectively and not the same. So, we I decide that it is a quadratic equation ; and we observe that N,-D,=3x+3 and that N,-D, is also 3x+3.

I Thus the two roots arc -514 and -1 ; and we have solved a quadratic equation at mere sight (without the usual parapher- nalia of cross-multiplication. transposition ctc.). We shall revert to this at a later stage (when dealing with quadratic equations themselves, as such). With the same sense 'total' of the word 'rSa~,cuemya' but in a different application, we have the same Siitra coming straight to our rescue, in the sol~ltion of what the various text-books everywhere describe as \"Harder Eq~~atioris\", and deal with in a very late chapter 'thereof under that caption. In fact, the labcl \"Harder\" has stuck to this type of equations to such an extent that they devote a separate section thereto and the Matriculation examiners everywhere would almost seem to have made it :in invariable rule of practice to include one question of this type in their examination-papers ! Now, suppose the equation before us is :- In all the text-books, we are told to transpose two of the terms (so that each sidc may have a plus term and a minus term), take the L.C.M. of the dcl~ominators, cross-multiply, equate the denominators, expand tliern, transpose and so on and so forth. And, after 10 or nlore steps of working, they tell you that 8 is the answer. The Vedic Siitra, however, tells us that, if (other elements being equal), the sum-total of the denominators on the L.H.S. and the total on the R.H.S. be the same, then that total is zero ! In this instance, as D,+D, s d D,+D, both total 2x-1G. :. 2x-16=0 :. x=8 ! And that is all there is to it !

This gives us the assurance that, on cross-multiplication, expansion etc. the x4 and the x8 coefficients will cancel out. Rut what about the x' coefficients ? For them too to vanish, it is necessary that the sum of the products of the independent terms taken two at a time C, should be the same on both the sides. And this is the case when if (x+a) (x+b) (x+c) (x+d)=(x+e) (x+g) (x+h), we have not merely a+b+c+d=e+f+g+h but also two other ' # conditions Fulfilled F (i) that the sum of any 2 binomials on the one side is ual to the sum of some two binomials on the other : and (ii) ab+cd on the left=ef+gh on the right.

This is of what may be described as the MERGER Type ; and this too includes several sub-headings nntlrr that heading. The first type : The first variety is one in which a number of termd om thc left hand side is equated to a single term on the right hand side, in such manner that N,+N,+N, etc., (the sum of the numerators on the lcft) and (the single nunierator on ,.lie right) are the same. For instanoe, 3 4 7 --+ ---- Here Nl+N, i.e. (3+4)--N(i.c. 7) x+l x-2 x+3 SO the Sfitra applies. The procedure is one of mergilig of the R.H.S. fraction into the left, so that only two terms remain. The process is as follows : As we Incan to lnrlyc the R.1I.S. into the L.H.S., we subtract the independent term of the to-be-merged binomial from the absolute tcrms in the binomials on the lcft aud ntulti- ply those remainders by the numerators of the terms on the left. And the process is complete. (i) We first put down the two to-be-retained denomi- nators down thus :- x T x-2 (ii) Then, as 3(from the R.H.S) is to be merged, we subtract that 3 from the 1 in the first term, obtain +2 as the remainder, mltiply it by the numerator (i.e. 3), get -6 as the product and put that down as the new numerator for our first term. (iii) And we do the same thing with the second term, obtain -4 as the product and set it down as our Numerator for the 2nd", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

The student may, however, for the sake of practice try the other methods also and get further verijcatiorb therefrom for the correctness of the answer just hereinabove arrived at. SIMULTANEOUS SIMPLE EQUATIONS Here too, we have the GENERAL FORMULA applicable to all cases (under the 'Par6vartya' Stitra) and also the special Siitras applicable only to special types of cases. THE GENERAL FORMULA The current system may congratulate and felicitate itself on having a fairly satisfactory method-known as t,he Cross- multiplication method-for the solving of simultaneous simple equations, which is somewhat akin to the Vedic 'Parcivartya' method and mmes very near thereto. But even here, the unfortunate drawback still remains that, in spite of all the arrow-directions etc., intendcd to facilitate its use, the students (and sometimes even the teachers) of Mathematics often get confused as regards the plus and the minus signs (+ and -) and how exactly they should be used ; and, consequently, we find most of them preferring-in actual daily practice-the substitution method or the elimination method (by which they frame new equations involving only x or only y). And this, of course, does not permit a one-line mental-method answer ; and it entails the expenditure of more time and more toil. The Vedic method (by the Parrivartya Rule) enables us to give the answer immediately (by rne1.e mental Arithmetic). Thus- 4x+5y = 14 The rule followed is the \"Cyclic\" one : (i) For the value of x, we start with the y-coefficients and the independent terms and cross-multiply forward (i.e. rightward) (i.e. we start from the upper row and multiply across by the lower one ; and conversely ; and the connecting link between the two cross-prodcts is always a minw). And this gives us our Numerator ; (ii) For finding the Denominator. we go from the upper row across to the lower one (i.e. the x coefficient) but backward (i.e. leftward). Thus, :. for the value of x, t,he numerator is 3 X 14- Ei;;II: I 5 x 8 = 2 ; and the Denominator is 8 ~ 4 - 2 ~ 5 = 2 In other words x - f - 1.

An example will make the meaning and the application clear : 6x+ 7y= 8 19x+14v= 16 Here we note that the v-coefficicnts are in the same ratio to each other as the independent terms are to each other.

There are other types of miscellaneous linear equations which can be treated by the Vedic Siitras. A few of them are i shown below. FIRST TYPE I Practio~s of a particular cyclical kind are involved here. And, by the ParStvartya Sfitra, we write down the Numerator of the sum-total of all the fractions in question and equate it I to zero. n u s : Here, each numerator is to be multiplied by the factor absent from its denominator.

These we can readily solve with the aid of the same \"Antyayoreva\" Siitra [but in a different context, and in a different sense). We therefore deal with this special type here.

CHAPTER XVII QUADRATIC EQUATIONS In the Vedic mathematics Sttras, CALCULUS comes in at a very early stage. As it so happens that DIFFERENTIAL calculus is made use of in the Vedic Sfitrqs for breaking a qua- dratic equation down at sight into two simple equations of the first degree and as we now go on to our study of the Vedic Siitras bearing on Quadratic equations, we shall begin this chapter with a breif exposition of the calculus. Being based on basic and fundamental first principles (relating to limiting values), they justifiably come into the picture at a very early stage. But these have been expounded and explained with enormous wealth of details covering not merely the SBtras themselves but also the sub-siitras, axioms, corollaries, implications etc. We do not propose to go into the arguments by which the calculus has been established but shall content ourselves with an exposition of the rules enjoined therein and the actual Modm Ope~andi. The principal rules are briefly given below : (i) In every quadratic expression (put in its standard form i.e. with 1 as the coefficient of xa), the sum of its two Binomial factors is its first differential. Thus, as regards the quadratic expression x2-5x+6, we know its binomial factors are (x-2) and (x-3). And there- fore, we can at once say thqt (2x-5) (which is the sum of these two factors) is its D, (i.e. first DIFFERENTIAL). (ii) This first differential (of each term) can aIso be obtained by multiplying its m (Dhwaja) w (Ghita) (i.e. the power by the (Ahka i.e. its coefficient) and reducing it by one. Thus, as regards x4-5x+6 x8 gives 2x ; -5x gives-5 ; and 6 gives zero. .*. Dl =. 2x-6. (iii) Defining the DISCRIMINANT as the square of the coefficient of the middle term minus thc product of double the first coefficient and double the independent term, the text then lays down the very important proposition that the first differential is equal to the square root of the discriminant. In the above case xa-5x+6=0 .'. 2 ~ - 5 = f 1/25-24 = f 1 Thus the given quadratic equation is broken down at sight into the above two simple equations i.e. 2x-5 = 1 and 2x-5=-1 ;. x=2 or 3 The current modern method (dealing with its standard quadratic equation ax8+bx+c", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 114, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "=0) tells us that : -b,t .\\/ba-pac This is no doubt all right, so far 8s it goes ; x = 2a but it is still a very crude and clumsy way of stating that the first differential is the square root df the discriminant. Another Indian method (of medieval times well-known as Shree Sbreedharacharya's method) is a bit better than the current modern Methods; but that too comes nowhere near the Vedic method which gives us (1) the relationship of the differential with the original quadratic (as the sum of its factors) and (2) its relationship with the discriminant as its square root ! and thirdly, breaks the original quadratic equation-at sight- into two simple equations which immediately give us the two values of x ! A few morc illustrations are shown hereunder : (1) 4xa-4xf 1 =(2x-1)(2x-1)=0 .'. 8x-4=0 (2) 7xa-EX-2= (x-1)(7~+2) =O .'. 14~-5 = f dFl= f 9 - (3) xa-llxf 10=(x-10)(x-1)=0 .'. 2x711 = ,t.\\/Sl= &9 (4) 6x2+5x-3=0 :. 12~+5=,t-9?

Differentiatioas, Integrations, Successive Differentiations, Integrations by means of continued fractions etc. But just now we are concerned only with the just here- inabove explained use of the differential calculus in the solution of quadratic equations (in general) because of the relationship D1 = f l/ the discrimiilant. The other applications just referred to will be dealt with at later stages in the student's progress. I1 This calculus-method is perfectly GENERAL i.e. it applies to all cases of quadratic equations. There are, however, certain special types of quadratic equations which can be still more easily and still more rapidly solved with the help of the special Siitras applicable to them. Some of these formulas are old friends but in a new garb and a new set-up, a new context and so on. And they are so efficient in the facilitating of mathe- matics work and in reducing the burden of the toil therein. We therefore go on to some of the most important amongst these special types.

As this factorisation and the addition or subtraction of the squares will not always be easy and readily possible, we shall, at a later stage, expound certain rules which will facilitate this work of expressing a given number as the sum of two sqllares or as the difference of two squaree. SECOND SPECIAL T17PE. (Under the Szinyalant Samtrccaye Formula.) We now take up a second special type of quadratic equa- tions which a very old friend (the Szinyam Sarnuccnyc Si~tra) can help us to soha at sight (a sort of problenl which the mathematicians all regard as \"Hard\") ! We may first remind the student of that portioil of arl earlier chapter wherein, referring to various t~ppllcations of the Samuccaye Szltra, we dealt with the easy method by which the oneness of the sunl of the numerator on the one hancl and tbe 21 denominator on the", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

We need not repeat all of it but only refer back to that poltion of this volume and remind the student of the kind of illustrative examples with which we illustrated our theme : THIRD SPEClAL TYPE There is a third special typc of Quadratic Equations which Is also generally considered \"very hard\" but whereof one root is readily yielded by the same arlcient friend (the \"Snmya Samu- coaye\" Satra and the other is given by another friend-not so ancient, however but still quite an old friend i.e. the \"S~nyaly, Anyat\" SzZtra which was used for a special type of simultaneous equations. Let us take a concrete instance of this type. Suppose we have to solve the equation: The nature of the characteristics of this special type will be recognisable with the help of the ueual old test and an additional new test. The TESTS are: $+a=+++; and #+$=$++ In all such cases, \"$finyam Anyat\" formula declares tlrat one root is zero ; and the \"k%nyam Samllecaye\" Stitra says : I),+D,=O :. 2x+5=0 :. x = -24 The Algebraical Proof hereof is as PoUows : 2 - (by simple division) = 1 -> . and so on, x+2 x+2 ' :.

(By the Samuccaye formula) 2x+5 =O ; Note :-In all these cases, Vibkanam (i.c. mere observation) gives us both the roots. A few more illustrations of this sperial type are given : Now, .: 1 - 2x and so on, 1 +2x 1-x -I---- :.x=O or (by cross-multiplication) 12x+B or (36x+15)=0 :. x- -5112 .. x=O or-i(a-tb) 4 ) a - 1 - - 1 ) b+c + ----- - - - x t a - b xfb-r x ~a+b-x-b-c :. x=O or )(c-a) FOURTH SPECIAL TYPE And again, there is still another special type of Quadratics which are \"harder\" but which our old friends \"$iiozya~ Anyat\" and \"Parcivartya\" (Merger) can help us to solve easily.

But these we shall go into and deal -with, at a later -stage. Just at present, we address ourselves to o~ur next appro- priate subject for this introductory and ill~st~~ative Volume namely, the solution of cubic and Biquadratic Equations etc. CUBIC EQUATIONS We solve cubic equations in various ways: (i) with the aid of the Parcivartya SBtra, the Lopnna- Sthapana Sfitra, the formula (Ptirana-Aptirncibhnydm) which means \"by the completion or nun-completion\" of the square, the cube, the fourth", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 119, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "power etc.) (ii) by the method of Argumentation and Factorisatiori (as explained in a previoua chapter). The Ptiraw M&hd The Piirapa method is well-known to the current system. -- In fact, the usually-in-vogue general formula -bf .\\/b8-4ac x = for the standard quadratic (axqbx+c =o) 211 has been worked out by this very method. Thus, axn+bx+c =O :. (Dividing by a), bx c xa+-+-=o a a . bx -c . . xz+-= - a a :. (completing the square on the L.H.S.) This method of \"completing the square\" is thus quite well- known to the mathematicians, in connection with the solving of Quadratic Equations. Bat this is only a fragmentary and fractional application of tfl? General Formula which (in conjunction with the Par6vartya, the Lopana-Sthapnu etc., Siitras) is equally applicable to cubic, biquadratic and other higher-degree equations as well. Completiltg the Cubic With regard to cuhic equations, we combine the Parcivartya SQCra (as explained in the 'Division by Pmciwtya' chapter) and the Paraw sub-formula. Thus, (1) xS-6x8+11x-6=0 .'. x3-6x2= -11x+6 But (~-2)S=xS-6~~+12~-8 :.

This is always applicable to all such cases (where x2 is absent) and should be fully utilised. The Pziranu method explained in this chapter for the soluiion of cubic equations will be found of great help in factorisation ;and vice-versa. \"Harder\" cubic equations will be taken up later. CHAPTER XIX BIQUADRATIC EQUATIONS The procedures (PGruw etc.,) expounded in tho previous chapter for the solution of cubic equations can be equally well applied in the case of Biquadratics etc., too. Thus, Note :-The student need hardly be reminded that all these examples (which have all been solved by the Piivapz method hereinabove) can also be solved by the Argn- mentation-cam-factorisation method. A SPECIAL TYPE There are several special types of Biquadratic equations dealt with in the Vedic Slit,ras. But we shall here deal with only one such special type and hold the others over to a later stage. - This type is one whcrcin the L.H.S. consists of the sum of the fourth powers of two Bmomiccls (and the R.H.S. gives us the equivalent thereof in the shtkfle of an arithmetical number.) The formula applicable to such cases is the +-w& (Vyasti Sanaasti) Sfitra (or the Lopana Sthdpana one) which teaches us how to use the average or the exact middle binomial for break- ing the Biquadratic down into a simple quadratic (by the easy device of mutual cancellation of the old powers i.e. the xS snd the x). A singh conclete illustration will uuffice for explaining this prooess : (x+7)'+(~+5)~=706. Let x+6 (the average of the two Binomials)=a ( 173 :. (a+l)4+(a-l)4=706 :.owing to the cancellation of", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS EQU4TIONS. We now go on to the solution of Simultaneous Equations involving three (or more) unknowns. The Lopam-Sthipanu Siit~a, the Antcrapya Siitra and the Par6vartya Siitra are the ones that we make use of for this purpose. FIRST TYPE In the first type thereof, we have a significant figure on the R.1I.S. in only one equation (and zeroes in the other two) From the homogeneous zero equations, we derive new equations defining two of tfhc unknowns in terms of the third; we then substitute these values in the third equation ; and thus we obtain the values of all the three unknowns. A second method is the judicious addition and subtract- ion of proportionate multiples for bringing about the elimina- tion of one unknown and the retention of the other two. In both these methods, we oan make our own choice of the unknown to be eliminated. the multiples to be taken etc., Thus : (i) A+C gives us : 4x+3y =10 ; :. 10x=10 B PA+B glves us: 6x--3y=oI :.

FACTORISATION AND D~PFERENTZIAL CALCULUS In this Chapter the relevant Siitras (Gupaka-Sam~ya etc.,) dealing with successive differentiations, covering Leibnity's theorem, Maclaurin's theorem, Taylor's theorem etc., and given a lot of other material which is yet to be studied and deciclecl on by the great ~natl~ematicians of the present-day westcrn world, is also given. Without going into the more abstruse details connected herewith, we shall, for the time-being, contei~t ourselves with a very brief sketch of the general and basic principles involved nrld a few pertinent sample-specimens by way of illustration. The basic principle is, of course, elucidated by the very nomenclature (1.e. the Gunaka-Samucmya) which postulates that, if and when a. quadratic expression is the product of the Binomials (x+a) and (x+b), its first differential is the sum of the said two factors and SO on (as already explained in ,the chapter on quadratic equations). I t need hardly be pointed out that the well-known rule of tliffercntiation of a product (i.e. that if y=uv, when u and v be d v the function of x , d ~ = v du+ U-) and the G'upaka-Samuccaya dx dx dx Sfitras denote, connote and imply the same ~nathematical truth.

CHAPTEK XXIII PARTIAL FRACTIONS e Another subject of very great importance in various mathe- matical operation8 in general and in Integral Calculus in particular is \"Partial Fractions\" for which the current systems have a very cumbrous procedure but which the 'Parivartya' Sltra tackles very quickly with its well-known MENTAL ONE- LINE answer process. We shall first explain the current method ; and, alonp-side of it, we shall demonstrate the \"Parciwrtya\" Sfitra application thereto. Suppose we have to express 3xa+12x+11 in the shape of Partial Fractions. (xS1) (x+2) (x+3) The current method is as follows: Let- 3xP+12xfll - -4 + B 4 C (x+1) ( ~ $ 2 ) (x+3) X+l x+2 x+3 . , . . +C(x +3x+2)- (x+l) (x+2) (x+3) :. xa(A+B+C)+x(5A+4B+3C)+(6A+3B+2C)- (3x2+12x+l I) :. Equating the coefficients of like powers on both sides, A+ Bf C= 3 5Af 4R+3C=12 6A+3B+2C=ll 1 :.Solving these three simultaneous equations involving three unknowns, we have, A=l ; B=l ; and C=l In the Vedic system, however, for getting the value of A, (i) we equate its denominator to zero and thus get the Pwdvartya value of A(i.e. -1) ; (ii) and we MENTALLY substitute this value -1 in the E, (but without the factor which is A's denominator on the R.H.S.) & ( 167 (iii) we put this result down as the value of A. Similarly for B and C.

Other details of applications of ParCavartya and other Sfitras to partial fractions, will be -dealt with later. 3. Just now we take up an important part of Integral Calculus wherein, with the help of partial fractions, we can easily perform difficult integrational work. INTEGRATION BY PARTIAL FRACTIONS In this chapter we shall deal, briefly, with the question of INTEGRATION by means of Partial Fractions. But, before we takc it up, it will not be out of place for us to give a skeleton- sort of summary of the first principles and process of integration (as dealt with by tlie ElcCdhika Satra). The original process of differentiation is, as is wellknown, a process in which we say : Let y=xa. Then Dl (i.e. *)=axa dx ; 1),=6x ; and Da=6 Now, ill the converse process, we have : -- dy-3x2 :. dy=3x2dx dx Integratiag, :. J ~ Y = J ~ X ' ~ X :. y=x9 Thus, in order to find the integral of a power of x, we add unity to the @ (Pfirva i.e, the original index) and divide the coefficient by the new index (i.e. the original one plus unity).

And this they do, not in order to conceal knowledge but in order to facilitate the recording of their arguments, and the derivation conolusions etc. The more so, because, in order, to help the pupil to memorise the material studied and assimilated they made it a general rule of practice to write even the most technical and abstruse text-books in Sfitras or in Verse (which is so much easier-even for the children-to memorise) than in prose (which is so much harder to get by heart and remember). And this is why we find not only theological, medical, astronomical and other such treatises but even huge big dictionaries in Sanskrit Verse ! So, from this stand-point, they used verse, Siitras and codes for lightening the buden and facilitating the work (by versifying scientific and even mathe- matical material in a readily assimilable form) ! The very fact that the alphabetical code (as used by them for t'his purpose) is in the natural order and can be immediately interpreted, is clear proof that the code language was resorted not for concealment but for greater ease in verificatio~~ etc., and", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

Thus, for instance, w, bpa, papa and yapa all mean 11 ; and the writer can (by a i proper selection of consonants and vowels) import another meaning also into the same verse.

Prelimimry Note We may begin this part of this work with a brief reference to the well-know1 distinction betseen non-recurring decimals, recurring ones and partly-recurring ones. (i) A denominator containing only 2 or 5 as factors gives us an ordinary (i.e. non-recur~ing or non-circulating) decimal fraction (each 2, 5 or 10 contributing one significant digit to the decimal). For instance, 1 = .0125 ;T)~=-!- = .Ol ; and sn on. 10e (ii) Denominators containing only 3, 7, 11", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

N.B. :-(i) Each 3 or 9 contributes only one recurring digit ; 11 gives 2 of them ; 7 gives 6 ; and other numbers make their own individual contribution (details of which will be explained later). (ii) In every non-recurring decimal with the standard numerator (i.e. I), it will be observed that the last digit of the denominator and the last digit of the equivalent decimal, multiplied together, will always yield a product ending in zero ; and (iii) In every recurring decimal x with the standard numerator (i.e. l), it wilI be similarly observed that 9 will invariably be the last digit of the prcduct of the last digit of the denominator and the last digit of its Recurring Decimal Equivalent (nay, the product is actually a continuous series of NINES) ! mus, )=.5; +.2; g o = - l ; $=.25;4=.125; ,\\=-0625; &='04; ,,',=.008; etc. . . . .

And then we observe that this second remainder (2) yields us the third remainder 6, and thereby keeps up the Geometrical Progression (with the aame ratio 1 : 3). In the same way, this 6 gives us 18 which (being greater than tlie divisor and being divided by it) gives us 4 as the fourth remainder. And 4 gives us 12 which (after division by 7) gives us 5 as the fifth remainder ! And, by the same ratio, this 5 gives us 15 which (when divided by 7) gives us 1 as the sixth Remainder.

For, in the actual result, it means tjhat, once we know the ratio between the first dividend and the first remainder (1 : 3 in the present case), we can-without actual further rlivision-automatically put down all the remainders (by maintaining the 1 : 3 Geo- metrical Progression). For example, in the present case, since the ratio is uniformly 1 : 3, therefore the second remainder is 9 (which after deducting the divisor), we set down a_s 2 ; and so on (until we reach 1). Thus our chart reads as follows : 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5. Yes ; but what do we gain by knowing the remainders beforehand (without actual division) ? The answer is that, as soor1 as we get the first remainder, our whole work is practi- cally over. For, since each remainder (with a zero affixed) autonlatically becomes the next dividend, we can mentally do this affixing at sight, mentally work out the division at each step and put down the quotient automatically (without worrying about the remainder) ! For, the remainder is already there in front of us ! Thus the remamdeis 1, 3, 2, 6, 4 and 5 give us (Dividend digits) the succesulve dividcntls 10, 30, 20, 60, 40 and 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5 50 ; and, d~vidlng these mentally. by 7, we can 1 4 2 8 5 7 go forward or backward and obla~n all the (Quotient-digits) quotient-dlg~ts 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, and 7.

There is, however, a still.more wonderful Vedic method by whieh, without doing even this little division-work, we can put down the quotient-digits automatically (forward or backward, from any point whatsoever) ! The relevant Siitra hereon says : alTim ($e@~ydfikmu Cararnepz and means : The Remainders by the last digit) : As explained in another context (in the very first chapter of this volume), the word by indicates that the operation is not one of addition or of subtraction but of division and of multiplication", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

The division-process (whereby we affix a eero to 1,3,2 etc., divide the product by 7 and set down the quotient) has been shown just above. We now show the reverse procegs of multi- plication, which is easier still. In so doing, we put down not the dividend-nucleus digits but the remainders themselves in order : 3,2,6,4,5,1. And, as we know from a previous paragraph that 7 is the last digit, we multiply the above-given remainders by 7 and put the last (i.e. the right-hand-most digit) down under each of the remainders (totally ignoring the other digit or digits, if any, of the product) !

In fact, in every case wherein the ]lumber of decimal places is more than 10, this is bound to happen ; and provision too there must be against it. In fact, the remedy is very simple i.e. that, even where digits occur more than once, there still are gradations ; and, if these are taken into account, the cyclic order and the ascending order of magnitude will still operate and serve their purpose.

The Second Method The second method is one wherein we avoid even this num- bering and marking etc., and (in accordance with the Adyam Adyenu rule), multiply the opening digit or digits of the basic decimal fraction (. 142857) and determine, therefrom the starting point for the multiple in question.

This is all right, so far as it goes. But what about a person who ha9 not got such a ready- to-hand table to refer to ? In such a case, should one newly prepare the basic chart and then manipulate it--cyclically- (in one of the ways just explained), for getting the required result ? That would, of course, be absurd.

(5) In the case of 17, the first four remainders are: 10, 15, 14 and 4. As 4 is a manageable multiplier, we may make use of it as a convenient and suitable remainder for this purpose. Let ue therefore multiply the group of four Remaindere (already found) by 4 and cast out the seventeens (wherever necessary).

And we get over this difficulty in the way just explained. And when we get a remainder which is numerically greater than the divisor, we cast off the divisor and put down the remain- der.

Number of Decimal Phes Students generally feel puzzled and non-plussed as to how to know beforehand the number of decimal places which, on division, the decimal equivalent of a given vulgar fraction will actually consist of. In answer hereta, we must point out that, having-in the immediately preceding sub-section on this subject-made a detailed, analytical study of the succcssive remainders, we have, in every case before us, practically a tabulated statement from which (without actual division to the very end) we can postulate beforehand all the forthcoming remainders. And the tabulated statement has the further merit that it can be prepared, at any time, at a moment's noticr l All this means, in effect, that, (i) As soon as 1 (or other starting point) is reached (in our mental analysis), we will have completed the whole work of-decimalisation and therefore know the actual number of decimal places coming ahead.

(iii) As soon as we reach a fairly small and manageable remainder (in our mental calculation), we know how many more steps we should expect. Let us again take the case of ) by way of illustration. The first remainder is 3 ; and used as a successive multiplier (with the provision for the casting out of the sevens), that first remainder-multiplicr brings US on to 1. When we have done two stcps and got 1 and 4 as the first two rpotient-digits, we find 2 is the remainder. Multi- plying the first group of two digits (14) by 2, we get 28 as the second-group (with the remainder also doubled i.e. 2 ~ 2 ~ 4 ) . 14/28/. Multiplying 28 by 2, we get 28 X2=56 as the third group and 4x2=8 as the remainder. And then, by casting out the sevens, we obtain 57 as the quotient-group and 1 as the remainder ! And as this was our starting-point, we stop further computations and decide that ), when decimalised, has 6 decimal places in the answer. Going hack to the case of ,l,, the student will remember that, after 4 steps, we got.0588 as the quotient-digits and 4 as t,he remainder. Multiplying the former by t,he latter, we obtained 2353 as the second quotient-group and 4x4316; as the remainder ; and there we stopped, (because we had the first 8 digits on hand and knew the other 8 digits). Thus ft gave us 16 digits.

But, as our denominators go on increasing, we note that, although the last digit of the decimal fraction is 1,3,7, or at the most 9 and no more, yet, the Ehxidhika Pfirva goes on increasing steadily all the time and we have to multiply or divide successively by bigger and bigger Elccidhikas, until, at last, with only two-digit der~orriinators like 61, 71 and 81 and so on, we have now to deal with 55, 64, 73 etc., as our multipliers and divisors, and surely this is not such an easy process. The objection is unobjectionable ; nay, it is perfectly correct. But we meet it with quite a variety of sound and valid answers which will be found very cogent and reasonable. They are as follows : (i) Even the biggest of our Ekidhikaa are nowhere -in res- pect of bignees-near the original divisor. In every case, they are smaller. But this is only a theoretical and dialectical answer from the comparative standpoint and does not really meet the intrinsic objection (about the Vedic methods being not only relatively better but also being free from all such flaws altogether) I We therefore go on and give a satisfactory answer from the positive and construotive stand-point. (ii) Even though the Ekridhika is found to be increasingly unmanageably big, yet the remainders give us a simple and easy device for getting over this difficu!ty. This we shall demonstrate presently. (iii) The Ekiidhiku (so far explained and applied) is not the whole armoury. There are other Auxiliaries too, wherein no such difficukty can crop up.

We know immediately that the last digit of the decimal is 3 and that the Ekidhika is 7. And then we work as follows : (i) Multiplying digit after digit (as usual) by 7, we have : or (ii) dividing digit by digit (as usual) by 7, we have : s ~ = & - . 0 4 3 4 7 8 2 6 0 8 6 / 9 5 6 5 2 1 7 3 9 1 3 2 3 5 5 1 4 6 4 6 These are the usual Ekddhika PPiirva methods.

Thus 39 gives us 117, out of which we put down 17 and keep 1 to carry over ; 17 gives 11s 51+1==52. 52 gives us 156, out of which we set down 56 and keep 1 to carry over. 56 gives us 168+1=169, of these, we put 69 down and keep 1 to be carried over ; and so on. In fact, the whole procedure is exactly like the one which we followed from left to right in respect of (='020408 16 32 ...... ). Thus we have : &=&=.0434780608, 69, 56, 52, 17, 39, 13 or(iv) if we wish to start from the left end, p on to the right, that too is easy enough. We note that, the first digits being completed, we get 8 as the Reminder. We can immediately work out this process by n~ultiplying each two-digit group by 8 (as we did in the case of & by 2) and frame the following chart : .04 : 32 : 72 : 24 : 08 : 64 : and so on : 2 : 6 : 2 : : 5 : : 3 4 : 7 8 : 2 6", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

We should therefore try and see what we can get from the Remainders. We find them to be 10, 6 etc. We can immediately pourlce up on this 6 for our purpose and work in this way: .02 being the &st two digits of the quotient and 6 being our ratio, the next two digits are obviously 12. These x 6 should give us 72 ; but as 4 will be coming over from the right, we add the 4 and put down 76. This should give us 456, of which the fitst digit has already been taken over to the left. So 56 remains. But this will be increased by 3 (coming from the right) and will become .%--This gives us 57, 44 and 68 for the next three 2- digit groups and 08 for the one thereafter. The 08 group of two digits gives us 48 which, with the carried digit becomes 51. This gives us 06 and 36 (which becomes 38). And then we have 28 (turning into 29, then 74 which becomes 78) and so forth.

We should therefore sift the remainders and find a suitable auxiliary therefrom. In this case, we find 7 is the &st significant remainder. So, leaving the EkLidhika process out of account for the moment, we may use the Geometrical Progression principle and achieve our purpose thereby (as we did-with 6-in the case of A).

Having dealt, i n mtenso, with the conversion of vulgar fractions into their equivalent recurring decimals, we now take up the CORVERSE process i.e. the conversion of decimals into the equivalent vulgar fractions. We do not, however, propose to go into such a detailed and exhaustive analytical study thereof (as we have done in the other case) but only to out and' explain one particular principle, which will be found very useful in this particular operation and in many subsequent ones. Tho principle is based, on the simple proposition that -9'=~-1; 3- .99=5$-1 ; .999'=8:;=1; and so forth ad injnitum. It therefore fo!lows that all recurring decimals whose digits are all nines are ipso facto equal to unity ; and if a given decimal can be multiplied by a multiplier in such a manner as to produce a product consisting of only nines as its digits, the operation desired becomes automatically complete. For instance, let us first start with the now familiar deci- mal -576923. In order to get 9 as the .O 7 6 9 2 3 last digit, we should multiply this by 3. 1 3 Setting this product down (.230769), -2 3 0 7 6 9 we find that, order to get 9 as the 6 - 7 6 9 2 3 penultimate digit, we should add 3 to Tg (i the 6 already there.

(ii) Each quotient-digit is the last digit of its corres- ponding remainder. This is because 1 is the last digit of the decimal. (2) In thecase of,',, the remainders are : (1) 10, 13, 14, 24, 8, 22, 17, 25, 18, 6, 2, 0, 26, 28/19, 16, 15; 5, 21, 7, 12, 4, 11, 23, 27, 9, 3, and 1.

This plus 8x being our second-step dividend, we multiply the divisor by the second quotient-digit 3x and subtract the product 21x2+9x therefrom and thus get 3x2-x as the remainder. But this 3x2 is really equal to 30x which (with -x+2) gives us 29x+2 as the last-step dividend.

It wiil be noted that the arithmetical example just here- above dealt with (i.e. Qp,\"A) is merely the arithmetical form of 38xS+9x2+8x+ 2 and the Arithmctioal chart has merely 7x+3 shown the above given algebraical opern- tion in its arithmetical shape (wherein 3 : 38 9 8 : 2 x=10) and that, whenever the algebraical 7 :: 3 3 : 1 working has taken a remainder-digit : 5 3 4 : 0 over to the right with a zero added, the arithmetical chart shows that particular remainder prefixed to the Q h t already there. Thus, where 3x8 has been counted as 30x2 and added to the 9xs already there and produced 39x2 as the result, this algebraical operation has been graphically pictured as the prefixing of 3 to 9 and making it 39 ! And similarly, in the next step of the division, the remainder 3 is prefixed to the 8 already there; and we have to deal with 38 ; and similarly, at least, the 1 prehed to the 2 gives us 12 (which the 3 X 4 subtracted therefrom cancels out) ! In other words, the given expression 38x3+9x2+8x+2 (with 10 substituted for x) is actually the same as 35x3+36x8+ 37x+12.

Thus, our second Gross Dividend is now 63. From that, we subtract 16 (the product or the first of the flag-digits i.e. 2 and the first quotient digit i.e. 8) and get the remainder (63-16=47) as the actual dividend. And, dividing it by 8, we have 5 and 7 as Q and R respectively and put them down at their proper places. SO now, our Gross Dividend is 71 ; and we deduct, by the Drdhva- Tiryak rule, the cross-products of the two flag-digits (23) and the two quotient-digits (85) i.e. 10+24=34 ; and our remainder is 71-34~37. We then continue to divide again by 8 and subtract etc., in the same manner (by cross-multiplication) as (just now explained) by the Urdhva-Tiryak method (until the last digit of the dividend) is reached. And that finishes the task. And, in other divisions too, irrespective of the number of digits in the divisor, we follow the same method. And, in every case, our actual divisor is of one digit only (or at the most, a small two-digit one (like 12, 16 and so on) which one can easily divide by) !

First Type The fist (and commonest) type thereof is a very simple and easy application of our self-same old friend the Ek6dhQa I PGrva. And the whole modus operandi is to replace the Deno- minator by its Ekidhika (i.e. to drop the last digit and increase the penultimate one by 1) and make a consequeritial alteration in the division-procedure (as in the case of other EkGdhika operations).

The queation now is : Does it stand to reason that the Ekcidlika should be the same in and in .JV, (irrespective of the difference in the number of nines) 1 That would be tantamount to declaring that the same (signi- ficant) numerator lor dividend) with two different denominators (or divisors) will yield the same quotient 1 And that would be palpably absurd ! Yes ; the objection is perfectly valid ; and the relevant Siitra has surmounted this difficulty beforehand, by providing for groups of quotient-digits (to which the remainder at each stage of the mental division should be prefixed)! And that ~oIves the whole probIem. Modus Operandi For insta~~ce, let us take the sixteerJth example supra (namely, a'g$$$ whose A.P. is 348-8 and whose denominator ends in four nines) : Here, F is f $g$b; and AF is Qb8u; and we have to make 5 (in lieu of 49999) our working divisor. As we have dropped 4 nines from the original denominator and have 5 as our Ekd- dhika in the Denolni~iator of the Auxiliary fraction, we have t,o divide the nin~~erator of the latter ia bundles, so to say, of 4 digits each by 5 ; a.nd, whatever remainder there is, has to be prefixed not to any part~ic~il:~r quotient-digit, but to the bundle just already reached. Thus, we tnlce up 2.1863 to start with and divide it by 6. We get 5 ) 2'1863 --- ,4372 as the h~sf [ Q=.4373 -R=3 quotient-group and 3 as the remainder. We prefix this remain- dcr to that group and say : .4372 and we divide this dividend (namely, 34372) 3 by the same divisor 5 ; and we get : 4 i.e. 6874 is thp, second quotient-group ; and 2 is the second remainder, which therefore we prefix to the second quotient group. And we continue this process with as many groups as we need. Thus we have : .4372, 6874, 5374, 9074 and so on 3", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

BUT the procedure is different, in a very important (nay, vital) particular. And this is that after the first division (or group-division is over) we prefix tlic remainder not to each quotient-digit but to its COUPLEMENT from NINE and carry on the division in this way all through. An illustrative instance will clarify this : (i) We divide 1.2 by 3 and set 4 down as the first quotient- digit and 0 as the first remainder. .4 0 (ii) We then divide not 04 but 05 (the complement of 4 from 9) by 3 and put 1 and 2 as the second quotient- digit and thc second remainder respectively. There- fore we have a 4 1 0 2 (iii) We take now, not 21 hut 28 ns our dividend, divide it by 3 and get: .4 I 9 0 2 1 (iv) Thus, dividing 10 by 3, we have : 4 1 9 3 9 0- 2 1 1 a.nd so on, until finally our chart reads: F (i.e. %;)= . 4 1 9 3 5 4 8 3 7 0 9 6 etc., etc. ! 0 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 1 Always, therefore, remember to take the conlplement jl\"rom 9) of each quotient-digit (and not the quotient-digit itself) for J the purpotie of further division, subtraction etc. TlGs is the whole secret of the second type of Auxiliary Fract on.

Well ; these too have been grandly catered for, in the shape of a simple application of the Anurtipya Siitra, whereby, after the pre-fixing of each' Remainder to the quotient-digit in question, we have to add to (or subtract fro&) the dividend at every step, as many times the quotient-digit as the divieor (i.e. the denominator) is below (or.above) the NORMAL which, in the case of all these Auxiliary fractions, is counted as ending, not in zero or a number of zeroes but in 9 or a eerie8 of nines ! For example, let F he &QI and suppose we have to exprem this vulgar fraction in its decimal shape (to, my, 16 places of decimals). Lest the student should have, in the course ot these peregrinations into snch very simple and easy methods of work, forgotten the tremendous difference between the current method and the Vedic method and thereby deprived himself of the requisite material for the purpose of cornparison and contrast, let us, for a brief while, picture the two methods to ourselves side by side and see what the exact position is.

DIVISIBILITY AND SIMPLE OSCULATORX We now take up the interesting (and intriguing) question as to how one can determine before-hand whether a certain given number (however long it may be) is dipisible by a certain given divisor and especially as to the Vedic pmcesses which can help us herein. The current system deals wth this subject but only In an ultra-superficial way and only in relation to what may be termed the most elementary elements thereof. Into details of these (including divisibility by 2, 5, 10, 3, 6, 9, 18, 11, 22 and so cn), we need not now enter (as they are well-known even to the mathematics-pupils at a very early stage of their mathematical study.) We shall take these for granted and &art aith the intermediate parts and then go on to the advanced portlons of the subject. The Osculators As we have to utilise the \" h s \" (Ve#ulzas =Osculators) tl~roughout this subject (of divisibility), we shall begin aith a simple definition thereof and the method of their application. Owing to the fact that our familiar old friend the Ekadhzha is the first of these osculators (i.e. the positive osculator), the task becomes all the simpler and easier. Over and aboxe the huge nur111)er of purposes which the Ekddhika hss already been shown to fulfil, it has the Curtl~er merit of helping us to readily determine the divisibility (or otherwise) of a certain given d~vidend by a certain given divisor.

Modus Operandi of Osculation Whenever a question of divisibility comes up, we can adopt the following procedure. Suppose, for instance, we wish to know-without actual division-whether 2774 is divisible by 19 (or not). We put down the digits in order as shown below. And we know that the Ek6dhika (osculator) is 2. (i) We multiply the last digit (4) by 2, add the prodllct (8) to the previous digit 7 and put the total (15) down under the second 2 7 7 4 15 right-hand digit. (ii) We multiply that dB by 2, add that 30 to the 7 on the upper row, cast out the nineteens 2 7 7 4 I (from that 37) and put down the 3715 I remainder 18 underneath that 7. (18) N.B.-This casting out of the nineteens may be more easily and speedily achieved by first osculating the I 15 itself, getting 11, adding it to the 7 2 7 7 4 (to the left-hand) on the top-row and 18 l5 putting the 18 down thereunder. i (iii) Wc then osculate that 18 with the 2 to the left on the upper row and get 38 ; or we may osculate the 18 itself, obtain 17, add the 2 and get 19 as the final. osculated result.

The osculator is 2 OR Secondly, we may arrive at the same result-as effectively but less spectaculariy by means of a continuous series of oscula- tions of the given number (2774) by the osculator (2) as here- inbefore explained.

The Negative Oscutator This is an application of the Parciva~tya Sctra and is called the Negative Osculator because it is a process not of addition (as in the case of sf the l3kdhih) but of Subtraction (leftward).

I How to Determine the Negative Oshclator Just as the B k a h i h (the positive Vetam) has been duly defined and can be correctly ascertained, similarly the Negative Osculator will also require to be determined by means of a proper definition and has been so defined with a view to proper recognition. It consists of two clauses : (i) In the case of all divisors ending in 1, simply drop the one ; and (ii) in the other cases, multiply so as to get 1 as the last digit of the product (i.e. 3 by 7, 7 by 3 and 9 by 9) ; and then apply the previous sub-clause (i.e. drop the 1).

The student-inquirer's requirements in this direction form the subject-matter of this chapter.

In this context, it should be noted that, as there are various types of divisors, there are consequent differences as to the nature and type of oscu~ators (positive andlor negative) which will suit them. They are generally of two categories: (i) those which end in nine (or a series of nines) [in whch case they come within the jurisdiction of the. E&dhiku (i.e. the Positive) Osculator] or, which terminate in or contain series of zeroes ending in 1, (in which case they come within the scope of operations performable with the aid of the Viparita (i.e. the negative) osculator ; and (ii) those which, by suitable multiplication, yield @ multiple of either of the two sorts described in sub- section (i) supra and can thus be tackled on that basis.

( 287 1 (1) Let the divisor be 499. It is obvious that its osculator P is 5 and covers 2 digits. This fact can be easily expressed in symbolical language by saying : P,=5 (2) In the m e of 1399, it is obvious that our osculator (positive) is 14 and covers 2 digits :. P,=14. (3) As for 1501, & obviously comes into play, is 15 and covers 2 digits. In other words, Q2=15. (4) For 2999, P is 3 and covers 3 digits :. P,=3 (5) For 5001, Q8=5 (6) For 7001, Q8=7 (7) For 79999, P4=8 (8) For 119999, P,=12 (9) For 800001, Q,=8 (10) For 900001, Q,=9 (11) For 799999, P,=8 (12) For 120000001, Q,=12 Gwrectness of the Symbology The osculation-process invariably gives us the original number itself (or a multiple thereof) or zero : For example, (i) 499 (with P,=5) gives us 4$5 (99)=4+495=499 (ii) 1399 (with P,=14) gives 13+14 (99)=13+1386=1399 (iii) 1501 (with Q2=15) gives 15x1-15=0 (iv) 2999 with P,=3) gives 2+3 (999)=2+2997=2999 (v) 5001 (with Q8=5) gives 5x1-5=0 (vi) 7001 (with Q8=7) gives 7 X 1-7=0 (vii) 79999 (with P4=8) gives 7+8 (9999)=79999 (viii) 119999 (with P,=12) gives 11+12 (9999)=119999 (ix) 800001 (with &,=8) gives 8X 1-8=0 (x) 900001 (with &,=9) gives 9x1-9=0 (xi) 799999 (with P,=8) gives 7+8 (99999)=799999 (xii) 120000001 (with Q,=IZ) gives 12><1-12=0 N.B. :-The osculation-rule is strictly adhered to ; and the P's and the Q's invariably yield the original dividend itself and zero respectively ! Utility and Significance of the Symbology The symbology has its deep significance and high practical utility in our determining of the divisibility (or otherwise) of a certain given npmber (however big) by a certain given divisor (however large), inasmuch as it throws light on (1) the number of digits to be taken in each group and (2) the actual osculator itself in each individual case hefore us. A few simple examples of each sort will clarify this: (1) Suppose the question is, Is 106656874269 divisible by 499 1 Here, at sight, P2=5.

In this very case (of 43), instead of multiplying it by 7, getting 301 as the product and ascertaining that Q,=3 is the osculator, we could also have multiplied the 43 by 3, got 129 as the product, found P1=13 to be the positive osculator and verified it.

Difference of two Square number8 Of the two, this is much easier. For, any number can be expressed as the difference of two square numbers. The Algebraical principle involved is to be found in the elementary formnla as-bs=(a+b) (a-b). This means that, if the given number can be expressed in the shape of the product of two numbers, our task is automatically finished. And this \"if\" imposes a condition which is very easy to fulfil. For, even if the given number is a f rime number, even then it can be correctly described as the product of itself and of unity. Thus 7 ~ 7 x 1 , 17=17X1, 197=197x1 and so on. In the next place, we have the derived formula : (a+b)a-(a-b)'=.4ab ; and therefore ab can always come into the picture as a!? '=i.e, (half the s~im)~-(half the difFe- (??)'-( 2 ) rence)2; and as any number can be expressed as ab, the problem is readily solved. And the larger the number of factorisations possible, the better. In fact, if we accept fractions too aa permissible, the number of possible solutions will be iiterall2/in$nite. For example, suppose we have to express 9 as the difference of two squares. We know that- The question, therefore, of expressing any number as the difference of two squares presents no difficulty at all !

A Simple Rule in. Operation We first turn our attention to a certain simple rule at work in the world of numbers, in this respect. We need not go into the relevant original Siitras and explain them (especially to our non-Sanslirit-knowing readers). Suffice it for us, for our present purpose, to explain their purport and their application. Let us take a particular scrics of \"mixed\" fractions, namely,-li, 2,8, 3:, 4; , 5& etc. which fulfil three conditions : (i) that the integer-portion conslsts of the natural numbers in order ; (ii) that the nuillerators are exactly the same ; and 38 (iii) t h k the denominators are the odd numbers, in order, commencing from 3 and going right on.

And the General Algebraical form being;, :. D,=zn+l ; and N=2n (n+l) :. Dm+Ne=(N+l)' or. (%1+1)~+4n~(n+ l)a=(2ne+2n+l)a The shape of it is perhaps frightening; but the t h i q in itself is very simple : and the best formula is Da+Na=(N+l)a, This means that when a 2 (given) f x 2 is a perfect square, we can readily find out x4. Thus, for instance, (i) If a (the given number) be 9, 2n+l=9 :. n=4 :. 4; is the fraction we want. And 92+40s=41a (ii) If a be 35, 2n+l=35 :. n=17 :. The fraction wanted is 173z=0# :. 36e+612a=613e. (iii) If a=5?, 2n+l=57 :. n=28 :. The required fraction is 28#+=34* :. 57e+1624a=16252 (iv) If a=l4l, 2nf l=141 :. n=70 :.

The Case of Even Nunabws Yes ; the square of an odd number is necessarily odd and I can be split up into two consecutive integers. But what about even numbers whose squares will always be even and cannot be 1 split up into two consecutive numbers ? And the answer is that such cases should be divided off by 2 (and other powers of 2) until an odd number is reached and then the b a l result should be multiplied proportionately. For example, if a=52, we divide it by 4 and get the odd number 13. Itssquare (169)=84+85 :. 13s+84a=862 :. (multiplying all the terms by 4), we say : 522+336a=340a.

CHAPTER XXXII ELEMENTARY SQUARING, CUBING ETC. In some of the earliest chapters of this treatise, we have dealt, at length, with multiplication-devices of various sorts, and squaring, cubing etc., are only a particular application thereof. This is why this subject too found an integral place of its own in those earlier chapters (on multiplication). And yet it so happens that the squaring, cubing etc., of numbers have a particular entity and individuality of their own ; and besides, they derive additional importance because of their intimate connection with the question of the square-root, the cube-root etc., (which we shall shortly be taking up). And, consequently, we shall now deal", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

Thus- 11s= 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 (ii) The second step is to put down, under the second and third numbers, just two tunes the said numbers themselves and add up. And that is all!

Our base being 100, the excess is 4. So we add not 4 (as we did in the squaring operation) but double that (i.e. 8) and thus have 104+8 (= 112) as the left-hand-most ort ti on of the cube.

And, as this is intimately connected with a procedure known as the Dwandwa Yoga (or the Duplex Combination Process) and as this is of still greater importance and utility at the next step on the larlder, namely, the easy and facile extrac- tion of square roots, we now go on to a brief study of this pro- cedure. 1 The Dwandwa-Yoga (07 the Duplex Combination Process) I The term \"Dwandwa Yoga\" (or Duplex) is used in two different senses. The first one is by squaring ; and the second one is by Cross-multiplication. And, in the preser~t context, / I it is used in both the senses (aa and 2ab). In the case of a single (central) digit, the square (aa etc.,) is meant ; and in the case of a number of even digits (say, a and b equidistant from the two ends), double the cross-product (2ab) is meant. A few examples will elucidate the procedure. Denoting the Duplex with the symbol D, we have: (1) For 2, D=22=4 (2) For 7, D=49 (3) For 34, D=2 (12)=24 (4) For 74, D=2 (28)=56 I (5) For 409, D=q (36)f 0=72 (6) For 071, D=0+49=49 I (7) For 713, D=2 (21)+la=43 I (8) For 734, n = 2 (28)+38=65 I 39 I (9) D for 7346==2 x42+2 x 12==108 (10) D for 26734=16+36+49=101 (11) D for 60172=24+0+la=25 (12) D for 73215=70+6+4=80 (13) D for 80607=112+0+36=148 (14) D for 77=2X49=98 (15) D for 521398=80+36+6=122 (16) D for 746213=42+8+12=62 (17) D for 12345679=18+28+36+20=102 (18) D for 370415291=6+126+0+ 40+1=173 (19) D for 432655897=56+54+32+60+25=227 This is merely a recapitulation of the Urdhva Tiryak process of multiplication as applied to squaring and needs no' exposition.

The basic or fundamental rules governing the extraction of the square root, are as follows: (1) The given number is fist arranged in two-digit groups (from right to left) ; and a single digit (if any) left over (at the left-hand-end) is counted as a simple group by itself. (2) The number of digits in the square root will be the same as the number of digit-groups in the given number itself (including a single digit (if any such there be). Thus 16 will count as one group, 144 as two groups and 1024 as two. (3) So, if the square root contains n digits, the square must consist of 2n or 2n-1 digits. (4) And, conversely, if the given number has n digits, the square root will contain _n or + digits. 2 2 (5) But, in cases of pire decimals, the number of digits in the square is always double that in the square root. (6) The squares of the first nine natural numbers are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81. This means: (i) that an exact square cannot end in 2, 3, 7 or 8 ; (ii) (a) that a complete square ending in 1 must have either 1 or 9 (mutual complements from 10) as the last digit of its square root ; ( m ) (b) that a square can end in 4, only if the square root ends in 2 or 8 (complements) ; (c) that the ending of a square in 6 or 0 means that its quare root too ends in 6 or 0 (respectively) ; (d) that a square ending in 6 must have 4 or 6 (complements) as the last digit in its square root ; and (e) that the termination of an exact square in 9 is possible, only if the square root ends in 3 or 7 (complements). In other words, this may be more briefly formulated thus : (a) that 1, 5, 6 and 0 at the end of a number reproduce themselves", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

N.B. As a single digit can never be more than 9, it follows therefore that, in our method of straight squaring, no divisor above 18 is necessary.

Further Procedure Let us now take a concrete case (the extraction of the square root of, say, 119716) and deal with it: (i) In the above given general chart, we have not only put down the single first digit of the square root wanted but also prefixed to the next dividend-digit, the remainder after our subtraction of the square of that first digit from the left-hand-most digit or digit-group of the given number. 1 1 : 9 7 1 6 : And we have also set down 6 : : as our divisor, the exact double : 3 : of the first digit of the quotient.

Without subtracting anything from it, we simply divide the 29 by the divisor 6 and put down II : 6 : the second quotient-digit 4 and 6 : : 2 5 the second remainder 5 in their - : 3 : 4 proper places as usual. (iii) Thus our third Gross Dividend is 57. From this we wbtract 16 (the square of the second quotient-digit), get 41 as the Actual Dividend, 11 : : divide it by 6 and set down the 6: : 2 5 5 : Q (6) and the R (5) in their -- : 3 : 4 6 proper places as usual. (iv) Our third gross dividend-unit is 51. From this we subtract the Dwandwa Yoga (Duplex) (=48), obtain 3 as the remainder, divide it 11 : 9716 by 6 and put d0w11 the & 6 : : 2553 1 (0) and the R (3) in their y 3 : 46 .OO proper places. -- (v) This gives us 36 ss our last gross dividend-unit. From this we subtract 36 (the DwaItdw .Yoga of the third quotient digit 6) ; get 0 aa Q and as R. sC This means that the work has been completed, that the given expreseion 11 : 9 7 1 6 I a perfect square and that 346 6: : 2 5 5 3 1 is ita square root. ~ n d that : : 6.0 tt is all.

(2) Thus, they all have their own distinct endings; and the is no possibility of over-lapping (or doubt as in the case of squares). (3) Therefore, the last digit of the cube root of an oxact cube is obvious : (i) Cube ends in 1 ; :. cube root ends in 1 ; (ii) C ends in 2 ; :. C R ends in 8 ; (ii) C ends in 3 ; :. C R ends in 7 ; (iv) C ends in 4 ; :. C R ends in 4 ; (v} C ends in 5 ; .= C R ends in 5 ; (vi) C ends in 6 ;", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

C R ends in 9 ; (4) In other words, (i) 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 0 repeat themselves in the cube- endings ; and (ii) 2, 3, 7 and 8 have an inter-play of complem~nts (from 10). (5) The number of digits in a cube root is the same as the number of 3-digit groups (ih the original cube) including a single aigit or a double-digit group (if any such there be). (6) The first digit of the cube-root will always be obvious (from the first group in the cube). (7) Thus, the number of digits, the first digit and the last digit of tho cube root of an exact cube are the data with which we start, when we enter on the work of extractir~g the cube root of an exact cube. Examples (Let a, 1 and n be the symbols for the first digit, the last digit and n the number of digits in the cube root of an exact cube).

The Chart-Preliminary and Procedure The ~rocedure is similar to the one adopted by us in \"Straight Division\" and particularly in the extraction of square roots. The only difference is that our divisor (in this context) will not be double the first digit of the root but thrice the sqetare thereof. h s we know the first digit at the very outset, our chart begins functioning as usual (as follows) : (1) 31", "source": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya_page_unknown"}

(2) The tens' place IS determined by 3 a% I (3) The hundreds' place is contributed to by 3 ab\"3a2c (4) The thousands' place is fornied by b3+6abc (5) The ten thousands' place is given by 3aca+3bac (6) The lakhs' placc is constituted of 3bce ; and I (7) The millions' place is formed by ca.

And the whole procedure is really of an argumentational character. Thus, (i) Prom the units' lace, we subtract as (or L3) ; and that eliminates the last digit. (ii) From the ten's place, we subtract 3a2b (or 3LaK) and thus eliminate the penultimate digit. (iii) From the hundreds' place, we subtract 3ah+3aba (or 2 3LzJ-)-31ka) and there-by eliminate the pre- penultimate digit.

As all numbers cannot be perfect cubes, it stands to reason that there should be a provision made for all cases. This, of course, there is; and this we now take up. First Principla It goes without saying that a11 the basic principles ex- plained and utilised in the previous chapter should hold good here too. We need not, therefore, re-iterate all that portion of the last chapter but may just, by way of recapitulation, remind ourselves of the colzelusions arrived at there and the mdw operandi in question. The Sepuence of the Various Dig& (1) The &st place by as (2) The second place by 3azb (3) The third place by 3ab2+3asc (4) The fourth place by 6abc+b3 (5) The fifth place by 3aca+3bac (6) The sixth place by 3bc\" (7) The seventh place by pa ; and so on. The Dividends, Qotients, and Remainders (1) The first D, Q and R are available at sight. (2) From the second dividend, no deduction is to be made. (3) From the third, subtract 3abz (4) From the fourth, deduct 6 abc+bs (5) from the fifth, subtract 3ac2+3b% (6) from the sixth, deduct 3bca (7) from the seventh, subtract c8. ; and so on. Let us take a concrete example, namely, 258 474 853 and see the modus o p e r a d i actually 258 : 4 74853 @ at work (step by step) 108 : : 42 100 : 6 : 3 0 (a) Put down 6 and 42 as first Q and fist R by mere V i l o h ~ m (inspection).

Subtract CP (~343) therefrom and set down 0 and 0 as our Q, and 6, This means that the give11 number is a perfect cube, that the work (of extracting its cube root) is over and that the cube root is 637. N.B. Proof of the correctness of our answer is, of course, readily available in the shape of the fact that 63V is the given number. But this will be too mudely and cruelly laborious. Sufficient proof, however, is afforded by the very fact that, on going into the decimal part of the answers, we find that all the quotients and all the remain- der sare zeroes.

Its ultra-smallness will give rise to big quotients (sometimes of several digits), the insufficiency of the remainders for the subtractions to be made and other such complications which will confuse the student's mind. In case the divisor actually happens to be too small, 1 two simple devices are available for surmounting this difficulty. (i) Take the first four (or 5 or 6) digits as one group and extract the cube root. For example, suppose we have to find out the cube root of 1346, 085.

This is, of course, per- fectly reasonable. The Schedule of Digits The Analytical digit-schedule for (a+b+c+d)' now stands as follows : (a) First digit (9 zeros)=~S-- (b) Second digit (8 zeros)=3a2b- (c) Third digit (7 zeros)=3ab2+3aac (d) Fourth digit (6 zeros)=6abc+bs+3a2d (e) Fifth digit (5 zeros)=6abd+3ac2+3b\"c- (f) Sixth digit (4 zeros)=6acd+3bc2+3b2c- (g) Seventh digit (3 zeros)=6b~d+3ad~+c~- (h) Eighth digit (2 zeros)=3bd2+3c2d- (i) Ninth digit (1 zero)=3cda- (j) Tenth digit (no zero)=da Consequent Subtractio~ (1) Q, and R, by mere inspection.

Note :-It will be noted that, just as the equating of d to zero in (a+b+c+d)S will automatically give us ( a + b + ~ ) ~ exactly so will the substitution of zero for d in the above schedule give w the necessary schedule for the three-digit cube root. As we go higher and higher up (with the number of digits in the cube root), the same process will be found at work. In other words, there is a general hrmula for n terms (n being any positive integer) ; and all these are only special applications of that formula (with n equal to 2, 3,4 and so on).

It, however, suffers from the draw-back that we have first to find the double-digit Q, cube it an& subtract it from the first five-digit portion of the dividend and that all the four operations are of big numbers. Second Device This is one in which we do not magnify the first group of digits but substitute (c+d) for c all through and tl~us have the sime (a+b+c)a procedure available to us.

Note :-It must be admitted that, although the double-digit method uses the (a+b+c)S schedule and avoids the (a+b+c+d)s one, yet it necessitates the division, multiplication and subtraction of big numbers and in therefore likely to cause more mistakes. It is obvious- by better and aafer to use the (a+b+c+d)s and deal with smaller numbers. In this particular case, however, as the given number terminates in an even number and is manifestly divisible by 8 (and perhaps 64 gr even 512), we can (in this case) utilise a third method which has already been explained (in the imme- diately preceding chapter), namely, divide out by 8 (and its powers) and thus diminish the magnitude of the given number.

The current method tells us to work as follows : I Take the general equation y,mx+c. Substituting the above values therein, We have: 9m+c=17; and 7m+c=-2. Solving this simultaneous equation in m and c, we have ; 9m+c=17 7m+c=-2 I :. 2m=l9 :. m=9# t Substituting this value of m (in either of the above two equations) we have, 66i+c= -2 :. c= -684. Substituting theee values of m and c in the Original General Equation (y=mx+c), we get y=9) x -68). :. Removing fractions, we have 2y=19x- 137. And then, by transposition, we say, 19%-2y=137. But this method is decidedly too long and cumbrous (and especially for euch a petty matter) ! And the Seed C w & Method (which uses the formula is equally cumbrous and confusing. y-Yl= Zs (x-xl) it ultimately amounts to the right thing ; but it does not make it elear and requires eeveral more steps of .working !

{"chunk_id": 235, "book": "vedic-maths-shankaracharya", "text": "x and y (on the left hand side) and the independent (on the Right hand-side) have to be filled in]. The Siitra tells us to do this very simply by : . (i) putting the difference of the y-co-ordinates as the x-coe5cient and vice versa ; and (ii) evaluating the independent term on that basis. For example, in the above example, the CO-ordinatea are : (9, 17) and (7, -2). (i) so our x-coefficient is 17-(-2)=19 (ii) and our y-coeaient is 9-7=2. Thus we have 19 X-2y as our L.H.S. straightaway. (iii) As for the absblute term on the R.H.S., as the straight line in question passes through the two given points, the substitution of the original co-ordinates of each of the points must give us the independent term. So, the substitution of the values 9 and 17 in the L.H.S. of the equation gives us 19x9-2~17=171-34=137 ! Or Substituting the values 7 and -2 therein, we get 19 x 7 -2x-2=133+4=137 ! And that is additional confkmation and verification ! But this is not all. There is also a third method by which we can obtain the independent term (on the R.H.S). And this is with the help of the rule about Adyam Antyam and Madhyam i.e. bc-ad (i.e. the product of the means minus the product of the extremes) ! So, we have 17 ~ 7 - 9 X- 2=119+18=137 ! And this is still further additional confirmation and verification ! So, the equation is :-19x-2y=137 which is exactly the same as the one obtained by the elaborate current method (with its simultaneous equations transpositions and substitu- tions etc; galore) ! And all the work involved in the Vedic method has been purely mentul, slwrt, simple and easy !

Now, the Vedic method herein is one by which we can immediately apply the \"l?rdhwa\" Siitra the Adyam Adyena Sara and the Lapam Sthipam Szitra and by merely looking at the frightful looking (but really harmless) Quadratic before us, readily by mere mental arithmetic, write down the answer to this question and say :-\"Yes ; and the straight lines are 3x-2y+7=0 and 4x+5y-5=0.

EVERY MAN A MATHEMATICIAN Now in Cahutta and peddling a miraculous commodity is His Holiness Jagad Guru Sri Shankaracharya of the Govardhan Peeth, Puri. Yet Sri Shankaracharya denies any spiritual or miraculous powers, giving the credit for his revolutionary knowledge to anonymous ancients who in 16 Sutras and 120 words laid down simple formulae for all the world's mathematical problems. The staggering gist of Sri Shankaracharya's peculiar knowledge is that he possesses the kr~ow-how to make a mathe- matical vacuum like myself receptive to the high voltage of higher mathematics. And that within the short period of one year. To a person who struggled helplessly with simple equa- tions atld simpler problems, year after school-going year and without the bolstering comfort of a single credit in the subject, the claim that I can face M.A. Mathematics fearlessly after only six months of arithmetical acrobatics, makes me an im- mediate devotee of His Holiness Jagad Guru Sri Shankaracharya of the Goverdhan Peeth, Puri. I was introduced to him in a small room in Hastings, a frail but young 75 year-old, wrapped in pale coral robes and wearing light spectacles. Behind him a bronze Buddha caught the rays of a trespassing sun, splintering them into a form of aura ; and had 'His Holiness' claimed divine inspiration, I would have belived him. He is that type of pexson, dedicated as, much as I hate using the word ; a sort of saint in saint's clothing, and no inkling of anything so mundane as a mathe. matical mind.

For my note reads \"Little children merely look at the sums written on the black- board and immediately shout out the answers ...... they ...... have merely to go on reeling off the digits, one after another forwards or backwards, by mere mental arithmetic (without needing pen, pencil, paper or slate).\" This is the sort of thing one usually refuses to believe. I did. Until I actually met His Holiness. Qn a child's blackboard, attended with devotion by my host's wife ; His HoIiness began demonstrating his pcculiar skill ; multiplication, division, fractions, algebra, and intricate excursions into higher mathematics for which I cannot find a name, all were reduced to a disarming simplicity.
