We have been maintaining the mp3 audio of these lessons at http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net we hope this book to supplement the mp3 audio. Suddenly we realized that when we wanted to go back and listen to a particular concept, it has been very difficult to track where that concept was talked about and in which lesson. So, it was an idea to provide a summary of each class highlighting the topics covered and the keynotes for each of the classes. That is the purpose of this book. A different student summarized each lesson and we tried to keep the overall format of the structure very similar. But, there would be some differences in the presentation due to individual’s style of writing. Each of the classes has several important concepts covered, examples solved along with key points in astrology that were relevant to the topic of discussion but, not really part of the concept that was being talked about. The intention was to capture all those points under “key points” section. In most cases other than the obvious the name of the person in the example charts is left out in this book so that, the listener of the audio will not be biased while analyzing the chart. In this volume we are capturing all lessons from 1 through 45 which were taught between 6 May 2004 and 12 June 2005. Appendix “A” highlights all the abbreviations used in this book. Appendix “B” is gives quick reference of all the lessons with example chart’s data. We are extremely thankful to Sri. P.V.R. Narasimha Rao for teaching the classes to benefit all astrology students. We are thankful to Pt. Sanjay Rath for the astrology conferences and allowing us to associate with Sri Jagannath Center for learning of Vedic Astrology. We are extremely thankful to Sri.Narayan Iyer of Sri Jagannath Center for readily accepting our request to provide the guidance in putting together this material. Our thanks to Master Manasvi Putcha and to Sri.Vijay Chitra for the graphics on the cover design and the Audio CD preparation. x Our sincere thanks to Sri. Prabhu Hingorani and Smt.

Mantras for learning astrology. 2. Introduction to Vedic astrology (basic concepts). Key Points: 1. Lord Ganesha/Ganapathi is the deity for learning astrology. The associated mantra is \"Om sri mahaganapataye namah\". 2. Recite the parampara mantra \"Hare Rama Krishna\". [This is the moola mantra for the \"Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare; Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare\" maha mantra.] This moola mantra tells you that, you have to analyze a horoscope from three different standpoints, namely, Lagna (Hari), Su (Rama), Mo (Krishna). Su represents atma, Mo represents the mind and Lagna (ASC) represents the physical body. These three form the tripod of life. 3. Another mantra to recite regularly is \"Om Shleem Dhleem Jjyotirbraahmaaya Namah\", which will make the derivation of knowledge from the universal light. 4. Another mantra is \"Om Shreem Dhleem Medhadakshinamurthaye Namah\" to remove the confusion in the mind of astrologers. 5. Recite these mantras 108 times (or 11 times, if 108 times if not possible). If you want you can also add \"Om\" in front of it, to safeguard from the mistakes. 6. There are 12 Rasis (signs) and 9 planets. The planets are Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Ju and Sa. Two more planets, Ra and Ke are used, which are not physical objects. These are points where the Moon’s orbit around the earth intersects the plane of the earth’s orbit around the Su. They are also called chaya grahas as these are formed of shadows. 7. The entire zodiac is divided into 12 equal parts (each of 30 degrees) and each such part is", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 3, "book": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01", "text": "called a rasi (sign). The first sign is Ar (Ar) and is also called Mesha in Sanskrit. Mesha spans 0 to 30 degrees. The next part is Taurus (Ta) or Vrishabha from 30 to 60 degrees. The subsequent Rasis in order are Gemini (Ge) or Mithuna, Cancer or Karkataka, Leo (Le) or Simha, Virgo (Vi) or Kanya, Libra (Li) or Tula, Scorpio (Sc) or Vrishchika, Sagittarius (Sg) or Dhanush, Capricorn (Cp) or Makara, Aquarius (Aq) or Kumbha and Pisces (Pi) or Meena. These divisions are based on real stars in the sky. 8. The book Brihat Parasara Hora Sastra (BHPS) is like a bible of astrology. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 2 9. ASC is a very important point and it shows you, self. All the other planets show other people or circumstances that are influencing you. So positions of the nine planets (in their respective signs) around the Lagna at the time of birth of a person, constitutes a rasi Chart. Similarly, rasi charts can be drawn for a group of people or a country. For example, the moment when certain persons got together and declared the formation of a party is the moment of the birth of the party and will determine the fortunes of it. 10. Lagna takes approximately 1 whole day to go around the zodiac and come back to the same point. For Mo it is about 29 days, for Su about 365 days (1 year), for Ma about 1.5 years, for Me and Ve about 1 year, for Ju about 12 years and finally for Sa approximately 30 years. Ra and Ke each take 18 years to go around the zodiac once, approximately. 11. The periods when transit Sa is posited in three signs i.e., the sign behind the Moon, the sign of the Mo and the sign ahead of the Mo are called Sade-Sati period. This period is important because Mo is the significator of the mind and Saturn’s placement in these signs may cause much trouble to mind. So each Sade-sati period is for 2.5 years and the total is 7.5 years for one full rotation of the zodiac. 12. From the earth, if a planet appears to go backward, it is called Vakri or retrograde. The process of retrogression is called vakra- gamanam. 13. According to the shastras, the whole universe is made of a ‘material’ called Narayana. Out of it, only", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

Jupiter, the Brihaspati, is the teacher of gods, represents our intelligence and power of discretion. Venus, Sukracharya, the teacher of the demons, represents the demonic / Rajasik qualities in us. The Su represents the atma / soul, the Mo represents the mind etc... 15. In Vedic astrology, there are so-called Varga chakras or divisional charts that we create for a person in addition to the rasi Chart, and in these charts the ASC changes in few minutes. According to maharshis of our tradition, the rasi chart shows our physical existence and health (i.e. physical manifestation) and each of the Varga chakras represents a specific area of our lives e.g. education, career, marriage etc. 16. If you don’t have any good muhurta pre-calculated for your purpose, you can use the muhurta of the mid day (i.e. when the Su is at the highest point in the sky at a particular location). This muhurta is called Abhijit muhurta and is universally good. Abhijit means great victory. The reason why shastras recommend on 3 this is because at mid day, the Su is located three signs (equivalent to 6 hrs) behind the ASC and thus will be located in the 10th house from the ASC (each Rasi is a house with ASC as the 1st house; the houses are counted in the zodiacal direction; 10th house represents one's karma and the success in it). Thus Su being in the 10th house is auspicious for any activity. 17. Astrology is a probabilistic knowledge of the future happenings in our lives and it helps us to mentally prepare for the good and the bad in the future. Astrology reveals hidden traits in a person’s personality. Astrology can offer remedies for certain bad situations. Lesson #2 Compiled by Devendra Naidoo Topics Covered: 1. Puranic stories and their relevance to individuals 2. Introduction to what the planet represents Key Points: 1. Stories of Puranas –took place in the whole universe. (These stories are not to be perceived as simple stories). Most of what is described in these stories is qualities that are with in us. These things happened in the big universe and cannot be perceived. Some Puranic story would unfold within you. 2. The planets show various aspects of oneself. 3.

Ju is the teacher of gods. All Gods are within us – represents the good qualities in us. Similarly, all demons are within us – refers the bad things within us. Ju represents intelligence. Ju lives in each one of us representing the godly qualities. 6. Ve is the teacher of demons (good demons). There is micro representation of Ve again within each one of us representing the demonly qualities. 7. Ve exists within you – rules enjoyment. The enjoyment is referred to high spirits and not meant to be harmful. As teacher of demons, he keeps the demons under control. 8. Each planet represents different qualities and unfolds within us as that quality. 9. Su shows the soul within you. Su is the king of your existence. 10. Ma is also called “Mahi Sutha” meaning son of Mahi (Earth) and is born from the sweat of Siva. Ma represented by Subrahmanya, stands for the initiative, drive and aggression. Ma shows career. Ma shows the drive to do things. Has the same energy as Subrahmanya. Ma governs the spirit of energy. 11. Mo represents the mind and shows the mood. Mo also represents the shodasa-kalas and the 16th divisional chart - shodasa varga chakra is ruled by Mo. Mo shows the mind – sometimes empty and sometimes full. The moon goes through various phases – 16 in total. Such as happy or sad – this also referred to mood swings. 12. Me governs the learning ability. He is the adopted son of Ju but, born to Mo and Tara Devi (w/o Ju). Ju did accept TaraDevi and Me as a student. Ju represents an ideal teacher and Me Lesson #2 5 represents an ideal student. In Buddhism Tara Devi is worshipped as mother. 13. Ju is Satwik planet, Me is Rajasik planet and both are Soumya grahas. 14. Mind needs some input from intelligence – which needs an agent to process it and give it to mind, that is the learning ability. i.e. Mo (mind) gets the input from Ju (intelligence) through Me (learning ability) 15. Chandra eloped with Tara Devi (wife of Jupiter). Bruhaspati is Guru (Ideal teacher). In Buddhism Tara Devi is worshipped as mother. One should look at the manifestation of this story within us.

Tara Devi (w/o Ju) is Sthri Shakti is the manifestation or expression of intelligence (intelligence by itself lives in vacuum and means nothing). With this manifestation, is born the learning intelligence. Now Ju (the intelligence) accepts Me (learning ability) as a son, student. Me now process that intelligence and mind acts on that processed intelligence. So, all the three planets Ju, Me and Mo need be strong in a chart for a person to be very smart. 18. Intelligence transfers whatever you know to learning ability and transitions to mind. Intelligence = Guru, Learning ability = Buddha (process information) Mind = Mo (execution of information. 19. Shiva is energy. Shakti is manifestation of that energy. Tara Devi – is the energy. Puranic Stories relevance: 20. Each of the puranic stories could have occurred in a different plane or a dimension that we may not perceive, but a microcosmic representation of it can unfold within each one of us as below. Puranas must be perceived to be eternal truths about you 21. Each of Vishnu’s avatara is formed with a particular planet’s energy. 22. Vamana Avatara is formed with Jupitarian energy.

Vamana is represented by learned humility. Vamana represents this humility. A very learned Brahmin – a dwarf is a representation of humility. Ju takes 12 years to go round the zodiac. 23.

This unfolds into astrological world as when Su and Ve together. When Ju and Su are together, it is meant to be good. This holds true even if Su is debilitated. On the other hand, when Ve and Su are close, Ve loses its energy to Su. This is called combustion. Ve gets combusted. This is called “Maudhyam” Its called in Sanskrit as “Asta Gandha”. Any planet close to Su gets combust (burned). Ju combustion is not bad. The most combustion to any planet happens to Ve. Ve becomes too weak to influence, therefore Su will give result in this example. 24. There is an exception to combustion. All planets close to Su get combust and become weak except Ra, Ke since they do not have physical bodies. Instead, when Ra, Ke with sun will eclipse Su and make Su very weak. 25. Kurma Avatara - Sa is discipline and hard work. Without Sa there wouldn’t be any achievement. For those who don’t work hard, he forces on them. He is also called Sani or manda planet. He moves very slowly. He takes 30years – to round the zodiac. One story is both tortoise and Manda move slowly. The other story is of Ksheera Sagara Mathanam - churning the mountain, when Vishnu took the Kurma Avatara and supported the mountain while the mountain was being churned. That mountain is our intelligence, the snake (or coil) churning is the tapasya, the nector that comes at end is the result and all the bad things that come in between are to be taken by Siva, that is why we need the guru. Here the discipline and the hard work needed to do all this is what is represented by the Saturnian energy. That is why we will see Sa strong in all of saints. Sa also shows steadfastness, nishkama karma yoga, austerity etc. Sa is perceived as a bad planet, but he puts people to work and makes things happen. 26.

Rama Avatara represented by Su – the solar energy – Rama belongs to Surya Vamsa, royal family. 31. Krishna Avatara is represented by Mo. Mo is a sweet planet, has no enemies. 32. Ma represents Narasimha Avatara. Ma is very anger, energetic, aggressive. 33. Buddha Avatara is represented by Me. Me stands for learning. Buddha went beyond Advaita and preached saying there is no god and god is within you. There could be different views people hold on this, but, Parasara mentioned in the classics linking Buddha Avatara to Me. 34. Ra represents Varaha Avatara. 35. Ke represents Matsya Avatara. 36. The correlations above are useful to know the planet to pray for giving moksha. 37. In Navamsa (D-9), planet in 12th house from Atma karaka (AMK) is the one that is going to give moksha to that native. Praying to that planet is going to put the native in the path of moksha. One of the uses of all the above correlation is to find that planet. 38. In Matsya Avatara, Vishnu rescues the Vedas being destroyed. Within us, the traditional knowledge when is being destroyed, Ke is the planet that rescues it. In case of Vedic people and astrologers Ke will be strong. 39. Ke also shows learning in a parampara. Ke shows moksha marga in a spiritual path. 40. Ra shows bhoga marga and rebirth. 41. Within everyone, there is always a clash between Ra and Ke. 42. Nature of planets.

How weekdays evolved. Key Points: 1. Concept of Hora: a. Weekdays, Sunday (Su), Monday (Mo), Tuesday (Ma), Wednesday (Me), Thursday (Ju), Friday (Ve), Saturday (Sa). b. What is the logic behind this order? ->HORA is the reason, there are 24 horas. First hora of the day starts at sunrise. 2. Brahma Gayatri (sunrise), Vishnu’s or Achyuta’s time (noon), Siva gayatri (sunset), Kali gayatri (not auspicious). 3. Distance from sun, speed w.r.t. to earth, the rule used for allocating houses to planets. (Sa is slowest). 4. Hindus consider 1day starting from one Sunrise to the next. 5. Astronomical fact is, Sa is slowest (takes 2.5yrs to move one sign, or 30yrs), Ju (takes 1yrs to move one rasi OR 12 yrs), Ma (1.5yrs), Su (1yr), Ve and Me and Mo - This is the order. 6. For Saturday, the horas starting with Sa will be Sa, Ju, Ma, Su, Ve, Me. Mo. This makes one cycle of 7 hours, so for one day (of 24hrs or horas), there will be three cycles followed by (24-21=3 horas of) Sa, Ju, Ma - Next day begins with Sun's HORA (Hence, the day after Saturday is Sunday) and so and so forth. 7.

(one of the strengths relate to a planet). 10. Me and Ju are planets of dharma, Sa is planet of Kama, Su and Ma are planets of Artha and Mo and Ve are planets of Moksha depending on how far away they are to a base, they are accordingly given strength. This planet association is used to compute “shadbalas” other strengths, which will be detailed in future classes. 11. Civil Calendar is Sun’s calendar. 12. Indian Solar calendar: Su enters Aries, MESHA masa. Su enters Vrishaba, vrishabha masa. Original Solar calendar, each month has 30 days. Lesson #5 17 13. When Su goes from 0 degrees to 1 degree, one solar day is complete. When Su is between 1 and 2 degrees, then its the 2nd day. 14. Whole year thus has 30*12 = 360 days. 15. Original Solar calendar and civil calendar were different, suns motion is variable and can be 29 days, 30 days and 27hours, 29 hours for a day...possible. However, this is not possible in civil calendar and sunrise is taken into account...and some people take suns position at noon time...nothing scientific, but a convention since 2 different calendars are mixed. 16. Lets compare today’s noon time and next year same day same time, sun will not be in the same position. 17. If you say the 4th day of Mesha masa, then it means sun is in the 4th degree of Mesha...it is so scientific. 18.

In our age, AMANTA is more popular in Karnataka and Andhra. b. Varahamihira and Jaimini spoke about Suklanta. c. In AMANTA, new months starts just after AMAVASYA. d. AMAVASYA ends when SUN and MOON are exactly at the same degree and a new SUKLA pratipada will start. e.

Jyestha is on the border of Vrischika and Dhanu. c. Nakshatra that is 180 degrees from the sign. d. Naming of the month is based on the full moon (Suklanta). Probably, people were using Suklanta calendars and later switched to amanta calendars. e. Months are being named on the nakshatra more often likely to be occupied by Mo on the pournimasya of the month. f. Name of the month is decided based on the constellation Mo is likely to occupy on the pournima day of that month. Adhika Masa: Su and Moon, both are moving. 39. Lets say, Su is in the beginning of the Mesha rasi. Mo will catch up with Su and new month begins, Vaisakha masa begins. Mo will go around the zodiac in around 29 days and by which time Su also has already moved...and its possible that Su hasn’t left Mesha...so, occasionally 2 times in 5 years, it happens that Su remains in the same rasi . Hence, 2 Vaisakha masas are possible and the second one called \"ADHIKA Vaisakha masa\" and the “NIJA Vaisakha masa” is the former. 40.

Not possible using the Western or Solar calendar (civil). Start of the Year: 42. Look at the sunrise to determine a Tithi. Do not confuse the civil calendar with lunar calendar. Its possible that a Tithi may span 2 civil days. Sunrise time will be the guiding factor. 43. Civil calendar is what we are worried about. Civil days are not aligned along the 1-12, 12-24 difference between sun and moon. Sometimes, tithi can be more than 24 hours also and spans more than 2 days. Let’s say Guru Pournima starts in India at 3:30 PM on March 4th and goes on 3:30 pm of next day (March 5). If you want to celebrate a festival which falls on such dates, then pick the civil day where, at the time of sunrise, the Tithi has Lessons on Vedic Astrology 20 already occurred. In this example, March 4th - sunrise, Pournimasya had not yet arrived. However, on March 5-sunrise, the Tithi has already arrived and has been so for a few hours. Hence, civil day-March 5 can be taken to celebrate Pournimasya. 44. Now, for someone in the USA, 3:30PM on March 4th (in India) is actually early hours of the morning of March 4th (5AM) and continues until next morning 5AM. Based on when the sunrise happens, the Tithi that can be active at sunrise is different from what is in India. This way, you find civil day when the Tithi of interest is at sunrise and that is the day of the festival in USA. 45. If a particular Tithi started at a particular time in India, it will start at the exact time here also. The Tithi is based on angle between sun and moon. Taking earth as the center, take the line between earth and sun and earth and moon, that is the longitude displacement between sun and moon. That degree determines the Tithi. 46. Starting of the Tithi will basically be the same; reference point is the center of the earth - Geo centric positions. Because of that, Hyderabad or Boston does not matter. 47.

However, there is one thing to remember when you count and move zodiacally, and that is to check if the sign is an odd sign or even sign. 38. Odd rasis or Male rasis - Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius. - Count normally in zodiacal fashion one house at a time. 39. Even rasis or Female rasis - Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn & Pisces. - Count from the 9th sign zodiacally. h. EXERCISE - Locate Su in D-10 if it is at 17 degrees in Leo i. First, Ar is a Male sign and count normally. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 28 40. 17 degrees is between 15 (5th part) degrees and 18 (6th part) degrees, means Su is in the 6th Rasi. j. Count 6 houses from Leo - Su is in Capricorn in D-10 k. EXERCISE - Locate Mo in D-10 if it is at 22 degrees in Scorpio. l. Scorpio is a female sign, 9th sign is Cancer. 22 degrees is between 21 and 24 degrees, which is the 8th part. So, the 8th from Cancer is Aquarius. Hence, Mo is in Aquarius. 41. Same logic applies to D3, D9, D24 and all other divisional charts. 42. In Rasi, 10th house shows the work that native does at a physical level. It doesn’t tell about the career of a person. When you say career, it is an environmental thing. 43. All divisional charts show the environments in which you(your body) operate in different aspects of your life.

Siva and Parvati are the natural karakas for marriage – when they are in the 7th house they can give marriage. Ex: “Namah Sivayai cha Nama Sivaya” 11 letters, 3 words – Siva and Parvati in 7th house bless the marriage. These are very effective, but are not from a particular Veda. 3. For specific Mantras from Vedas, it is a good idea to pray to the Guru who gave that Mantra or to the Rishi of that mantra before reciting them. Ex. Vishwamitra is the Rishi for Rigveda mantra “Vrishabam Charsha….” Chart Analysis: 4. Each house signifies several matters –relevant house for that matter is seen from that house in the corresponding divisional chart. Ex 4th house stands for several things like mother, education, comfort, heart, real estate etc, so for education see 4th house in D-24, for mother see 4th house in D-12 etc. 4th in Rasi chart shows heart. 5. In any chart note the following in that order in seeing charts a. First find the divisional chart that we want to see. b. Then see the house that we are interested in. For ex. to see the learning of Jyotisha, see 8th house in D-24. 4th shows general education. c. Who owns (lord of) that house? The planet is the boss for that aspect. This planet can set the rules for that house. Lesson #7 33 d. Who occupies it? The occupants have control of that house and exert what is done. e.

The necha-bhanga raja yoga is triggered by the owner of the house where the neecha planet is. 41. Tapasvi Yoga – Ve, Sa, Ke are together, mutual trine or opposite each other. Ke – detachment, Sa gives austerity ability to work hard, and endure, Ve gives the passion and the pleasure (rapture) that comes from Tapasya. It will happen in any house. It is all the more stronger if it happens in Moksha trikona (8th or 12th – 8th is more important, since 8th is sadhana and siddhi where as 12th is moksha). 8th, 12th houses are dusthanas (bad houses) for materialism, but are very auspicious for Sadhana. 42.

Ju in the 10th house is the karma sthana in Pi (house of Maharshis), the karma is related to Jupiterian karma. 6. Su, Ma, Ra, Ke and Sa are natural malefics. Mo of Krishna paksha is Malefic (kroora) and Mo in sukla paksha is benefic. In this chart Mo is 2nd lord in 6th house with Su (3rd lord) another Malefic and is aspected by Ma.

Desire is essential for business – So see 6th for service and see 7th for business. 35. This chart 7th is stronger. Has 2 kama trikona lords - 3rd lord Ve and 11th lord Ra conjoining in the house of desire. So, this seems to be clearly a chart of a businessman. 36. Also, Ve is the karaka for desire in any chart. 37. In dasamsa, LL in 9th house means a lot of independence and you are your own boss. In business, it shows he is his own boss. In D-24, it shows Guru. 38. 7th lord Me is in 10th", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

Also Me has argala from 7th house making it all the more stronger. 39. Also, any planet having an argala from its own house is strengthened. 40. Me shows business, computer professionals, analytical mathematical ability etc; Su shows politics; Ju shows judges, teachers; Ma shows soldiers; Ke shows religious people, acetics, Ra shows terrorists; Ve shows entertainment people, dancing girls etc. 41. Me also shows speakers and journalists. Me, Mo show traders or Vysyas. 42. Me amsa in this chart is kubera. So, all his desire and karma is related to money. 43. Dharma trikona defines his dharma in society. It is quite strong in this chart. ASC in Pi has Ma and Ke and 9th house Sc has Ju. So, there is Parivartana between Ju and Ma. There by Ju in ASC is strong giving a Maha Purusha Yoga. 44. There are Maha Purusha yogas are given by – Ju (Hamsa yoga), Ma (Ruchaka Yoga), Ve (Malavya Yoga), Me (Bhadra Yoga), Sa (Sasi Yoga). For this yoga to occur the planet has to be in a quadrant (house of effort) and has to be in own house, exalted or in Moolatrikona. 45. Hamsa (stands for purity) maha purusha yoga will be someone who is very pious, religious. Adding to this, Ju is in Iaasana Lesson #8 41 amsa – pious. Also, Ju exchanged houses with 9th house of dharma. 46. To see the kind of career one is in, see the Argala on the 10th house. There is 4th house argala of Ma, Ke on 10th house (Sg), indicate hardware business. 47. Sg is the Agni Rasi and is the dharma sthana of the natural zodiac being his 10th house, it shows that he does his karma with a lot of fire. Lesson #9 Compiled by Sivarama Seshu Putcha Topics covered: 1. Arudha Padas – Introduction. 2. Example chart1: Apr 4, 1970; 5:47 pm; Machilipatnam, India; 5:30 E of GMT. 3. Example chart2: 1 Nov 1973, 4:07 am, 74E51, 12N54. 4. Example chart3: Jan 12, 1863; 6:33 am; 83E30, 33N40; 5:54 E of GMT. Key Points: Arudha Padas: 1. Grahas, Rasis, Bhavas and Vargas are the Four basic pillars of Vedic astrology. 2. Arudha Padas are often mistaken to be Jaimini Astrology (Refer Jaimini Upadesas Sutras by Pt Sanjay Rath). Parasara has talked about them too (Refer", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 36, "book": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01", "text": "BPHS). It may be noted that Jaimini has written in depth about the subject. 3. The actual houses, for example, 5th house of abilities does not really show the measurable or perceivable aspect of the ability. Whereas an award marks in an examination, trophies are perceivable. 4. Arudha means a “risen one”. Arudha Pada is the risen aspect – the perceivable aspect of any given house. It is the tangible aspect of a given house. 5. Arudha of the 5th house is represented by “A5” (Refer JHORA 7) and so on. 6. The analogy is, the actual house is like an object, the lord of the house is like a mirror and the Arudha is the image of object in the mirror (lord). From any house, find the distance from that house to its lord and Arudha of that house is the same distance from the house containing the lord. 7. AL is Arudha Lagna and UL is the Arudha of 12th house, otherwise known as Upapada Lagna (UL). AL is one’s image – how people perceive the native. 8. 1St house is Brahma sthana, 7th house (house of desire, marriage) is Siva Sthana and stronger of these two is where Narayana lives. Both 1st and 7th are to be seen for judging one’s attitude. 9. 1st and the 7th houses are of Satya and Arudha is the Maya. So, there is an exception in this case – if the Arudha falls in the 1st or 7th of corresponding house (not from Lagna) – then take the 10th house from where the computed Arudha is, to find the real Lesson #9 43 Arudha of that house. That means its Karma Sthana rules the Arudha. 10. In case of dual ownership of Sc and Aq, take the stronger of those houses to be the lord to find its Arudha. There will be actually two Arudha’s in these cases of different strength, which can manifest during their aspects 11. Arudhas can be seen in any divisional chart. Ex – A4 in D-16 will show what kind of car one has. – Vahana sukha in 4th house and vahana in A10. 12. Sg is the dharma sthana of the natural zodiac and is an agni rasi. 13. For example if Sa is in A10, then he will be doing Sa kind of work and more can be said depending on what amsa Sa", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

A10 will show what kind of work one is doing, where as 10th from A10 will show the perception people have in their minds on the work the native is doing. 14. Rasi is a chart of physical existence. It also shows different body parts. Arudhas in Rasi show the tangible aspects of the physical body. 15. All the houses in varga charkas show the environments Example chart1: Dasamsa Analysis. 16. Lagna (Asc) is in Vi. Vi owned by Me has analytical ability. Vi is a virgin, a sign of chastity and shows purity. 17. The true self of purity and overly analytical etc. can not be seen by people. It is intangible. What is tangible is the image AL. 18. AL is in Cp with Ju and Ke. So, people perceive this native to be of Ju and Ke nature – Intelligence, detachment etc. 19. 10th lord Me is in Ta and A10 (Arudha of 10th house) is in Ar. This shows the actual work that the native is doing. 20. 9th lord Ve is in Ge and 10th lord Me is in Ta. This gives a parivartana an exchange and that makes Me behave as it is in 10th house Ge and Ve behaves as it is in 9th house Ta. Me in 10th will show an engineer, shows Mercurian work. So there is another view of Arudha of houses in case of Parivartana. This is found by our guru Narasimha’s practical experience. In this case, take Me after parivartana as it is in 10th house and then AL will be in Pi. But, due to exception (if result happens to be 1st of 7th take 10th from there) the 10th from Pi will be Sg and that will be another Arudha Lagna. 21. So, second arudha lagna being in Sg (agni rasi) with Ma shows to the people that the native is dharmic, very aggressive and fiery in nature as far as the image of self is concerned in karmamsa. 22. The original AL also will work. There will be 2 images. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 44 23. Engineering, Legislation, Trading, Journalism are shown by Agni – indicating transformation. But, being Me we considered Engineering for the native. 24. Question: Are there any remedial measures to strengthen some houses? 25. Answer: Arudha shows the physical manifestation of an aspect.

For example, for 10th house, in this chart consider A10 lord Ma (in Ta). Do anything concerning 10th house on Tuesday being for Ma. Arudha being a physical aspect, instead of mantra, one can also take a physical suffering on that day by fasting. So, fast on Tuesday and propitiate the god of 2nd house from A10, the 2nd house being the house of sustenance. 26. Example: Strengthen A5 in this chart. A5 is in Ta. The lord of 2nd from A5 is Me. God of Me is Vishnu. So, fast on Friday and the pray Vishnu for strengthening recognition. 27. Example – In case of house of dual ownership, consider the stronger planet – A3 in Pi. 3rd house is for communication skills that can not be seen. The tangible aspect of this is a book written, a lecture etc. are shown from A3 being in Pi and having argala from Ju, Ke and Me show the nature of these manifestations. 28. A planet in debilitation and retrograde is akin to being exalted. An exalted planet being vakri is akin to being debilitated. In this chart Ju is debilitated and vakri. 29. If Ke is in any house, count backwards when calculating Argala. 30. Neecha bhanga of any planet is given by the lord of that house or the lord of the conjoining planet’s house is in a Kendra from Lagna (Asc) or the exalted planet of that house being in a Kendra. 31. A planet in retrogression shows a strong desire from past life. That desire is related to the houses that planet owns. Apply this rule to the Rasi or the corresponding chart wherever the retrogression is. 32. Graha drishti will be shown during a particular dasa. 33. Vi is application of intelligence, Sa shows hard work, Ma shows forcefulness. So, Ma and Sa in this case will impact the writings due to Rasi drishti. 34. Apply Arudhas only to physical (1-12) and mental charts only. Don’t apply them to charts beyond. 35. AL of D-60 is the Lagna (Asc) of past life. 36. 3rd house apart from communication shows initiative and bravery. A3 shows the weapons that one has. 3rd from A3 will show the perception of people on how brave the native is. Lesson #9 45 37.", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

So, see who is occupying 3rd and 6th – Malefics or benefics. 38. Rules are different for 3rd and 6th seen from Lagna (Asc) or AL. From Lagna (Asc) 6th will show overcoming obstacles whereas from AL it will show defeating enemies. Example Chart 2: 39. Lagna (Asc) is in Vi. AL is in Cp. 3rd is vacant, so she is not overly brave to pull other people around her. 6th house has Sa and Ke. So, once she feels enemical about someone, she will destroy them. So the image she projects is a materialistic nature. 40. From AL, If 3rd house is with no planets or with benefics, one really doesn’t have big bravery to pull other people around, but if 6th has malefics, one will not have hesitation to defeat them. 41. If 3rd and 6th are malefics – High initiative, brave and complete the task 42. If 3rd Malefic, 6th Benefic – High initiative but no execution 43. 3rd benefic, 6th Malefic – Not much initiative and bravery, but once started for whatever reason, they will finish it. 44. 3rd, 6th both benefics – no initiative, no execution – this is more a saintly person. Example Chart 3: 45. Ju in 3rd house and Ve and Me in 6th house from AL in Rasi. As far as initiative is concerned, he is very wise and in any fight with anyone, he will simply withdraw. This is a Saintly chart. 46. If a malefic in 6th house but debilitated, then one give up and not pursue will either halfway through or at the end. A malefic in neecha behaves like a benefic and a benefic in neecha will behave like a malefic. Ma is an exception. 47. The attitude of a person can be seen from 3rd and 6th houses from AL from different divisional charts on different aspects of that person.

The analogy is that, the house being the object, the lord of the house being the mirror and the Arudha being the reflection of the object through the mirror. 3. Arudha of a house is at the same distance from the lord of that house as the lord of the house is from the corresponding house. 4. Lagna (Asc) is the seed of one’s existence and for example, when Mo is in La with A11 and A5, then, during the Mo dasa/Antardasa, there will be gains due to A11 and recognition of abilities due to A5 and there will be a new beginning since its in La. 5. Arudha Padas are not real, real aspects are from original house that we can’t see. Arudhas are the tangible reflections and illusions and are Maya. And these are important as we are in the Maya world. Also, Mo shows Parvati and Devi who stand for Maya. 6. AL is the Arudha of the La and it shows the image of one’s self. Its not to be considered artificial as the true self projects this image itself. 7. Houses from AL show the perceived image in people’s mind. 8. Maha dasa level is ruled by Su. This period captures more stable things Su representing satya and the self will rule. Hence Su important at this level. 9. At Antardasa level and for Arudha’s, Mo is important. Antardasas are ruled by Mo. Chandra Lagna (Mo as La) is also important as it shows the mind. 10. Mo is the significator or the karaka for Arudhas. 11. 8th house stands for sudden changes, working hard and also indicates occult knowledge. Lesson #10 47 12. Enemies are tangible obstacles represented by A6. If the planet of interest is in 12th from A6, it means giving up of enemies, which means less opposition. If its so in D-24, it means less opposition in examinations etc. 13. 9th house shows Guru and Dharma. Sa shows traditional knowledge. 14.

In 3rd house does not show much initiative as he is slow to start anything. But, once started, he will finish it quick. Sa and Ma are extremes and if they have influence on 3rd house, there will be mixed results. 17. Argala is a conclusive intervention. 18. Quadrants are Vishnu sthanas showing efforts and Trines are Lakshmi sthanas showing blessings. 19. Ra shows engineering, Research etc. Me will show analytical, math, journalism etc. 20. 10th house shows karma sthana and D-20 shows religious activities and spiritual growth. 5th house shows abilities. The ability required for spiritual growth is Bhakti and Devotion. 21. In general, the nth house from La shows real aspects. An shows the tangible (visible) aspects of the nth house. The nth house from AL shows the perceived image in people’s mind. 22. Exalted planets are akin to people who are excited and are carrying good fortune. Debilitated is who is little unhappy and can give results only by working hard. 23. In D-20, especially a debilitated planet is very strong – It shows a lot a patience and submission. Ex. Ve debilitated shows submission to Lakshmi. 24. 5th house shows the abilities and A5 indicating its tangible aspects – if there is a link between these houses in D-20, it means that the mantras and the actual rituals performed are directly to the Bhakti and devotion one is having. 25. In D-20, Ju is the karaka for Mantra. With Ju in Li and Ve in Vi and A5 in Sg in D-20 means that there is a great possibility of starting a new mantra during Ju dasa/Antardasa of a given period. This is because, Ju is the owner of Sg, which is occupied by A5 and Ju being in a Venusian Rasi (Li) and Ve (in Vi) having Rasi drishti on Sg (with A5). So, during Ju period, there is a greater a greater possibility that a new Mantra will be started. Ve has a greater influence on A5 than other planets since Ju is itself in a Venusian sign.

So, during Ju antardasa, he can meet with Jupiterian like people. It is also with A8. So, during Sa dasa, results of 8th house results can be given, since, Sa is the owner of the 8th house. And if we look at Ju Antardasa in Pi with A8. So, in Sa dasa and Ju antardasa, 8th house results can be given – a break or a manifested occult knowledge or mrityu or end to education. There can be breaks in education. Also, Ju is the karaka for Vedic knowledge. Pi is a satwik and sign of sign of Maharshis. So, Ju in Pi can also give astrological knowledge. A8 can mean tantrum knowledge too, but, since its during Ju, it will be knowledge of maharshis like astrological studies. Also, the Sa dasa and Ju antardasa is a perfect combination to give a boost to occult knowledge, as Sa is very conducive to occult. 28. In D-10, a particular dasa/antardasa with A8 can mean a break in service. 29. A8 is also called Mrityu pada. 30. We can go to the extent of six levels of dasa periods, but we need to have an accurate time. If we don’t, then there will be lot of displacement in the houses. 31. When we use Antardasas, pay attention to Arudhas. Any planet that occupies an Arudha or has argala on a Arudha will tend to give its result during that antardasa. Example Chart 2: 32. Le Lagna – Su is the king of the solar system. Authoritative, Respectful. AL is in Sc - Ar is the determination akin to fire. In sc it is determination akin to watery and cool. 33.

In this example, Sa is in Sarpa shastiamsa and indicates the results of a sarpa Yoga. Sarpa Yoga indicates that the person feels like a snake coils him Lesson #10 49 – in other words he is having constant troubles. In this case, it is Sa sitting on the head (La). Su as LL in devamsa shows excellent wisdom, maturity and intelligence. 36. LL is called Paka Lagna and shows the intelligence – shows how he feels, acts etc... 37. Maturity comes from LL and its karaka is Ju. 38. If any house has its lord in a trine, that house will have the blessings of Lakshmi. 39. Amruta shatiamsa means nectar. 12th lord in Amruta shastiamsa means he is a great giver, someone similar to Karna. 40. Vamsa Khayamsa means family-decay, if the planet owning 4th & 9th houses is in this amsa, its not auspicious – This shows some problem with respect to growth of the family. 41. 8th house stands for troubles, tensions, sudden changes and even death. If Ra in 8th house, its bad, means cheating and when Ra is involved, it shows sudden shock. Dusthana – Mrityu sthana. Sa in 8th house will show sadness. Ra in 8th is not good for health overall. 42. Usually people who have strong Mo are reactive and people who have strong ASC are proactive. Vimsottari can be started from Mo or LA, depending upon whichever is stronger. 43. A6 is also called roga pada, so in Ra MD you should still take the Arudha since Ra is the planet of materialism and maya, where as Ke is the planet of getting away from Maya and take the native to moksha.

Bravery (boldness) is also an aspect of initiative. 2. 5th house shows abilities and dharma comes from ability of the individual. That’s how 1-5-9 houses are tied together. The dharma is not same for everyone. One with high abilities will have a high dharma and one with a low ability will have a low dharma. 3. Example with 3rd house is , A3 will show the tangible aspect of the initiative that the world can see where as 3rd house shows the inherent initiative and 3rd from AL shows what the world thinks of the native’s initiative. 4. 6th house will show war, whereas 3rd house will show the initiative (or a spark) for a war. For ex: war can be within a person – overcoming any obstacle is a war. 5. The house from ASC show the real and intangible aspects that even the native may not be able to perceive. 6.

In case if they are not linked, and for ex, if A3 has a Malefic like RA and the 3rd from AL has a benefic like JU, then it will be that the person could be very brave, but in people’s mind, he may be perceived as someone who is lacking in Bravery. Lesson #11 51 10. 5th house shows abilities whereas, A5 will show the awards and the recognition one gets as a result of abilities. This will happen during the dasa of the planet associated with A5. 11. 6th house is very important to complete something overcoming obstacles. 12. Also, 3rd and 6th houses are very important for accomplishing anything. If 3rd house has a very Malefic, it will show that the person will have a great initiative. 13. Rasi is the chart of physical existence. All the divisional charts show the environment of a given aspect. In Rasi chart, if 11th lord in 12th house basically does not show a loss but shows that all the gains will be spent and he will not keep any with him. This dictum is applicable to all the charts not just the Rasi chart. It has to be applied to whatever that divisional chart stands for. 14. As far as mind is concerned, it is so conscious about the body and hence Rasi is important since it represents physical existence. But, if we are interested in a particular chart, go to that specific divisional chart. 15. If 5th and 12th lord is in 9th house in D-24, it means esp. gain vedanga knowledge (due to 5th house) and give it away and that is the dharma this person has to follow. 16. Planets in 8th house in Rasi chart show that the person is very hardworking all the time. 17. Never ignore the shastiamsa (D-60).

Rasi drishti always exists where as graha drishti and argala effect during that particular planet’s dasa. 5th house has secondary argala, mentioned in future lessons. 19. The karaka is like a project Manager, Lord of a house is like a group leader and the planets in a house are like the team members. 20. Maha dasa is ruled by Su whichever planet’s maha dasa it is. Su shows Satya. The level of Antardasa is ruled by Mo. Mo shows mind, devi and maya. Arudhas are more important at this level. 21. LL shows new beginning and if its in 3rd house in Rasi, it will show that bravery and initiative and all the more auspicious when combined with 3rd lord. 22. Ra, Ke will show big explosive weapons, sudden shocking explosive weapons like nuclear weapons. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 52 23. A planet owning a trine and a quadrant is a Yogakaraka and it is an auspicious planet. 24. To see a particular planet's dasa, see what houses that planet occupies rasi and see what amsa ruler that planet has in D-60, that will give that property that planet carries. “Komala” amsa is tender “Davaagni” amsa is forest fire (turbulence). If a planet is in this amsa, it basically shows lot of turbulence destroying rotten things and creating a new beginning during that period. 25. For Ta La, Me is 2nd and 5th lord and is a benefic and will be a good dasa, but it will carry the amsa property of what Me stands for in D-60 chart.

Ke is also called Dhooma ketu and will burn whichever house he occupies other than when he is in 3, 6, 11. 31. Ra, Ke are significators of foreign affairs. 32.

Look at 7th house as maraka in other natal charts, but exclude that view in D9. 44. For divorce, look at 8th house (2nd from 7th) - mrityu sthana. Look at 8th house for break in marriage, 6th house for fight in D-9. A7 shows tangible relation between the native and other. In dharmamsa, it’s more between native and spouce. The 7th house shows the relationship one has with his/her spouse. 7th from AL shows the perception people have about this relationship. 45.

For second marriage see 8th from 7th and for its break see 2nd from there. In case of third marriage, see 8th from the second marriage. 50. Since Navamsa is for marriage, the amsa rulers of D-9 are Manushya, Deva and Rakshasa and they show the amsa of dharma. 51. 2, 6 and 10 artha-trikona are important for career and not just 10th house. 10th lord if Sa would indicate a routine work. 52.

Lesson #12 Compiled by Sivarama Seshu Putcha Topics covered: 1. Revision of aspects, dharma-artha-kama-moksha trines and dasas. 2. Example chart1: Sanjay Gandhi Dec. 14,1946 9:30:25 AM IST 72E50 80N58. Key Points: Revision of General Concepts: 1. ASC shows the essence of one’s being – immeasurable and unperceivable. AL shows measurable image of self and houses from there show the quality of that image. Arudha of any house show the tangible aspect of that house. 2. Karakas are like project managers – Ex Ve is a karaka for a project called “marriage”. The house lord is like boss or group leader. 3. Aspects – Rasi drishti is permanent influence. Graha drishti is temporary during a particular dasa. Its like a planet that has a desire to influence and argala is a conclusive intervention – it has to happen. The relation between the planet, the karaka and the house lord are important and depending upon this 3-way relationship the desire may/may not fructify. 4. Dharma – 1, 5, 9 where 1- existence, 5-abilities and 9 is duties; Artha – 2,6,10 where 2 is resources, 6 is overcoming obstacles, and 10 is karma; Kama 3,7,11 where 3 is drive and initiative, 7 is desire and 11 is gains; Moksha – 4, 8 and 12 where 4 is happiness - it’s a starting point for moksha, 8 is put in hard work w/o selfishness and 12 is giving away w/o attachment. 5. A new dasa starts when one is reborn. For an object in womb a conception chart or adhana chakra is drawn – it uses progression of Su in vimsottari as against Mo. Vimsottari dasa is for 120 years and shows the progression of moon. Moola dasa shows the root. It is like seeing the root whereas vimsottari is like seeing the plant. Moola dasa shows the cause (root) of something happening now(vimsottari). Drig dasa shows the direction or god’s blessings (drig means drishti). Su dasa shows the progression of SL – abode of Lakshmi – shows blessings one receives. Narayana dasa shows the progression of Narayana or true self. Chart drawn at time of death is called “punya chakra” 6. Ju rules Agna chakra. Intelligence and intuition come from there.

Sa is an important planet in life w/o him its difficult to get away the bad karma – Sa can show spiritual progress. 9. 3rd and 6th from AL show the boldness and fighting abilities. 3rd/6th having malefics means a materialistic person, Benefics means a saintly person. 10. Ar, Le, Sg are agni rasis; Ta, Vi, Cp are Bhoo rasis; Ge, Vi, Aq are Vayu rasis and Cn, Sc and Pi are Jala rasis. 11. AL in Li with Ma in Sg (3rd) is a fully malefic and is a materialistic person. AL with Ve and Ju – entertaining and pleasure to be with. 12. 2nd from AL – house of resources is very important in the world of Maya. 2nd from AL is Sc with Me, Su and Ke. Ke in upachaya and also in own house is very strong. Shows strong resources but has malefic link due to Ke and has political connections due to Su. 13. Two enemical planets in the same house and very close if in ASC show a split personality and if in AL show different images to people. For ex – Ve and Ju in Li with AL in this chart. 14.

Me in 3rd good authoring skills – writing books. 25. When looking at spouse’s or other’s chart from a given natives chart, do not consider Arudhas. Look at Arudhas only in the native’s chart. Remember that when you see another’s chart from a given native’s chart, it is only the view as seen from this native’s point-of-view. This can differ when you look at same person’s chart from another’s relative’s point-of-view. D-10 Analysis: 26. ASC in Vi with Me – true nature is Intelligent, thinking. 27. 9th house dharma has Ju in it – so strong sense of dharma in karmamsa. 28. 10th house with Ve (9th lord) and Ra (6th lord), AL – Ra in this chart shows in discharging duties has to overcome lot of enemies and will also create new ones. AL being with Ra gives a demon like image while executing his work. 29. 7th from ASC shows the desire, A7 shows the inter-action while 7th from AL (in the world of maya) shows fighting. 30. 3rd lord Ke in 4th, 7th from AL afflicting Mo shows something related to “burning things to ashes” during Mo dasa in executing his karma. 31. Thumb rule – strong 6th house – service and strong 7th house is business (due to 7th – interaction) 32. 6th house shows overcoming obstacles with authority if aspected by Su, with aggression if aspected by Ma, with hard work if aspected by Sa, ignore and walk away if aspected by Ke and so on.

Ma (blood, anger), Sa (blue, melancholy) are two extremes, they fight and any other planet in that house will be affected. This is avoidable combination. Father: 39. 9th lord is Me in Aq.

Cn – owned by Mo stands for compassion and sensitivity. b. Ta – sign of aggression c. Vi – sign of analytical ability d. Ge – sign of communication e. Pi – sign of spiritual attainment f. Sg – sign of upholding dharma. 42. If 4th and 9th lords are in quadrants or trines to each other, then mother and father have a good relation. If one is 2nd from other, then the other planet is in 12th from first. This forms a 2-12 relation – called dwir-dwaadasa. A similar combination involving 6th and 8th houses forming 6-8 relationship is called shad-astaka. Both these are bad – there will be not be good relation and will not get well together.

In this chart, Ju in Cn for grand father and Ma in Cp are in mutual quadrants, hence mother and grand father get along well whereas Ju in Cn for grand father and Me in Aq for father forms a 6-8 relation and hence, they will not get along well. Brother: 45. Drekkana or Parasari D-3 for brother. Younger sibling take 3rd house in forward direction, i.e. 3rd, 5th, 7th etc. For elder sibling take 3rd backwards 11th, 9th, 7th etc. 46.

There are several drekkanas – somnath drekkana shows the sexuality of a person. All drekkanas show the 3rd aspect of drive and initiation. 51. Parivrithi traya (PV) drekkana shows the application of determination. It shows the direction where the determination is applied. Planets in quadrants are important as they show where the determination is applied. 52. PV D-3 is not for brother, it is for the native – It shows where one feels like applying the determination to. It is the seed. 53. Ju in Pi if 9th house shows idealistic dharma. Me in Vi if 9th house shows pragmatic dharma. If a planet is badly placed, propitiating the friends of that planet can also help.

Example Chart 1: US President (2000-200_) George W. Bush. Birth data: July 6, 1946, 7:26 (4:00 West of GMT), New Heaven, CT, USA (72 W 55’00”, 41 N 18’00”) 5. Example Chart 2: Birth Data - Male, August 31, 1953, 4:05 AM, 83E18, 17N42. Birth chart rectification and D-10 analysis. Key Notes: There are 3 kinds of karakas: 1. Naisargika karakas (natural significators, 9 in number). 2. Chara karakas (variable significators, 8 in number), and, 3. Sthira karakas (fixed significators, 7 in number), One should not use the three types of karakas in a mixed-up way. Karakas of each type have a specific purpose. One should understand the distinction between chara, sthira and naisargika karakas clearly and use them accordingly. Naisargika karakas shows everything that exists in the creation. They include Rahu, Ke and the seven planets. They are presided by Brahma. Naisargika karakas are very useful in phalita Jyotish, i.e. analysis of general results. Chara karakas include Ra and the seven planets. They do not include Ketu, as Ke stands for moksha (emancipation) and does not stand for any person who affects one’s sustenance. Chara karakas are presided by Vishnu. Chara karakas show people who play an important role in one’s sustenance and achievements. Examples are – mother, father, wife, advisors etc. Sthira karakas include only 7 planets because only they have physical bodies. They are presided by Shiva. As Shiva presides over death, they show the destruction of body. Sthira karakas are useful in timing the death of various near relatives. Charakarakas: Lesson #16 69 The planet with the highest advancement is Atma Karaka (significator of Self) and denoted by AK.

Dharma is guiding Atma. 4. If AK & PK are together in Rasi Chart will give great Raja Yoga. If the Raja yoga is in 1st house or 5th house, it is very powerful and they rise very high. It is like blind following (Swami Vivekananda great follower of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa). 5. If AK & PiK are together in Rasi Chart will also give great Raja Yoga. Also if it is in 1st house or 5th house, again very powerful, but the difference is someone like fatherly figure will guide you. In Navamsa, it will be dharmic rise and in Rasi physical rise. 6. Take AK as ASC and analyze all other karakas in Rasi chart: 7. If any karakas are placed in 6th house, 8th house, and 12th house, soul gives-up that karaka. Take AK as ASC and analyze all other karakas in Navamsa chart: 8. If any other karakas are placed in 6th H, 8th H, and 12th H, dharma will suffer related to that karaka. 9. In Navamsa (D-9), the 10th H shows Karma related to one’s dharma and how it is promoted Lessons on Vedic Astrology 70 10. In Dasamsa (D-10), the 9th H shows sense of dharma while doing karma. Example Chart 2: Birth Time rectification using known events. 11. First check in Rasi chart, see when ASC will change the sign. 12. Also check Navamsa LA. In the current example chart, the ASC will change the sign, if the time is 2 min 56 sec earlier. 13. Take marriage event and using Tithi Pravesa chart for that year, the Navamsa ASC accuracy is established. Birth time is correct for D-9. Key points of career analysis using Dasamsa (D-10): 14. Check for any links between the 3 houses of Artha trikonas from ASC (2nd, 6th, and 10th houses). 15. The 2nd house is strong; the resources are very strong in the native’s career. 16. If the 10th house strong, it will show achievements and if the 6th house strong, it will show over coming obstacles. 17.

The Mo is in 7th house will show Godliness and spreading of religiousness in the society. Mo and Ju are in Kendras (7th & 10th houses), will form Gaja Kesari Yoga and will achieve native’s desire. 20. Native lost the job in Oct 2002. According to VD, in Ju MD and Ma AD, lost the job. Because, JU is Badhakesh for Vi LA, and capable of giving some trouble. Ma is 3rd H lord and can give short breaks in career. Also it is aspecting 8th H by rasi drishti and this will give long break in career. Lesson #17 Compiled by Vijay K. Chitra Topics Covered: 1. Example chart 1: Individual: Male; May 21, 1974; 3:58 PM (IST); Bangalore, INDIA – 77 E 35’, 12 N 59’ - Brief discussion on Chara karaka (AK & AmK) replacement 2. Example chart 2: Individual: Male; September 16, 1961; ORIGINAL TIME -> 2:34:00 PM (Uncertainty is 20 minutes); Secundrabad, INDIA – 78 E 30’, 17 N 27’ - Time rectification (later fixed to 2:22 pm) and Career analysis using D-10 Chart Key Points: 1. When 2 planets are in same degree, the higher becomes AK and next higher becomes AmK 2. But later in the life, AK will be replaced by AmK and this will become AK. Example Chart 1: 3. Ma is at 25 Ge 11’ 07.51” and Ve is at 25 Pi 10’ 39.39”. So Ma is AK and Ve is AmK. Ma will replace by Ve in the later life. It is difficult to predict when this will happen. AmK slot will be empty. When chara karaka changes in life, all dynamics of soul will change. When Ma was AK, it was in 9th H of dharma and the soul focused on dharma. But Ve is not well placed in D-9, it is in 6th H of over coming obstacles. It is some kind of spiritual transformation taking place; one has to struggle a lot in life.

Ve is with Su, like Ve is access to life (Su is natural giver of life). Sa & Ra has argala on Ve and it is very good, because Sa & Ra are lords of the house Ve occupied. This also confirms that, one will have to work hard. Ve is Aq sign; it is a sign of Philosophy. The soul becomes philosopher and it will stay throughout the life. Su will decide the direction, because it is with Ve. Individual soul (Ve) will get light/direction from universal soul (Su). 5. To look Ista-Devata, always take Ma has AK. Example Chart 2: 6. Check for Birth Time accuracy by looking facile features. 7. ASC can be either Sg or Cp, but according to appearance it is Sg. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 72 8. Native married, on December 8, 1986 and check this event in D- 9 to verify the birth time. 9. According to Vimsottari Dasa (VD), Ke MD and Ve AD is running, is marriage possible? Ve owns 6th and 11th house. 6th H is not conducive to marriage even though Ve is karaka for marriage. This ASC may be not correct. 10. Using Annual TP chart, (data: December 8, 1986), let’s verify the marriage event in TP D-9. The Hora lord is Ma, and owns 4th and 11th H, also in UL and with LL Sa. This does not make sense to give marriage. 11. Change time by 12 min backwards and the ASC changes to Sg in TP D-9. This is better possibility for marriage, because 7th lord is in ASC and Parivartana between 6th and LL s (Ju & Ve). 7th and LL are conjoined; there is very good chance that, the native will get married this year. 12. UL should have some strength to get married. UL is along with Ke, it is 2nd karaka for the marriage. It represents traditional marriage. Ke is also signifies, “Vamsa Vridhi” (family lineage). 13. In TP Tithi Ashtottari, Ma MD and Ve AD the actual marriage occurred. Ma being ruler of the year, this is possible. Actually 7th lord coming to ASC gave the marriage.

Lord Narasimha Deva is more suitable auspicious deity for worshiping and this will take the native close to moksha. One can also worship other deities nothing will go bad. Worship shall be satwik. D-10 Analysis: 17. D-10 ASC will change when the time 1m 30 later, but based on events, this seems to be correct for now. Let’s check with actual job responsibilities. 18. Me, MD and Ra, AD the native got the first job. 19. Ve & Me are 2 artha trikonas and joined together in 5th house and it is possible to give the job. Ra is in ASC along with A5. The 2nd house is resource; Sa is in 2nd and shows native will work hard. 20. There is correlation between 2nd from ASC and 2nd from AL. Both show strong resources, worldly as well as karma (work) prospective. Lesson #17 73 21. Nature of native Karma: Look for amsa. ASC being in “Brahma” amsa, shows keep digging as well as figuring it out on his own. Also Ra in ASC will show research. 22. Is 10th house or 10th lord is stronger? Su is in 10th house and 10th lord Ve is with 2nd lord Me. Both are aspecting 2nd house and 6th lord. All 3 artha trikona lord will play crucial role in career. 23. Su is LL and it is going into 10th house; the focus of entire existence is on Karma. Su is in Anantha amsa, which is spiritual enlistment and management. 24. Actual career is given by stronger of 10th lord. Here Ve & Me together. Ve is in enemy sign and Me is associated the 2nd and 6th houses and joining 10th house.

Annual TP D-7 Analysis: To confirm native’s children’s activity in the current year. 31. Native’s 1st child: D-7 ASC is even sign, so count 5 signs backwards for the 1st child. It is Pi and the lord Ju is in Aq. So take Aq as the ASC and analyze the chart in normal way. 32. Ju in ASC will show spiritual activity and interest in learning Jupitarien subjects. Sa is LL and is with Ke. This will also detachment and discipline in pursuit of spiritual activities. Already spiritual person will have strong desire in achieving those in this year. 33. 6th lord in 12th house will give Vipareeta Raja Yoga. 34. 5th lord and 9th lord conjunction is Maha Raja Yoga and it is happing in 9th house of dharma. This year is very important for following Dharma. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 74 35. During this period, native’s son left USA and went to India, to learn Vedic knowledge. This can be seen in the native chart (Native will miss his son). 36. According to D-7 LA, Ju is in 8th, it is “Dusthana” and native (father) will miss his son or will have arguments with son. Lot of anxiety to father. Natal D-7 Analysis: To check, over all activity in the 1st child life using VD 37.

As per Vimsottari dasa, Ma dasa (2004-11-07 – 2004-12-05) is good one to find the job 43. Will this job increase the status or Native has to settle for less: Check AL, which is in Cp. Ma is in 12th from AL, there will be lowering the image. 44. 9th lord Mo and 4th lord Sa is conjoining in 5th house of recognition. So Mo dasa is very good candidate for over all prospects in career. 45. Ma & Ju (through Ve Parivartana with Ju) conjoining gives raja Yoga in D-10 as well as D-1. 46. 7th lord Ve is in “Kubera” amsa. Kubera associated with money. Ve is bringing some money mindedness in this year. Ma, Ve & Ju dasas are very auspicious for any kind business. 47. Ju and Ve both are big role in this year, because Ju is in Ananta Amsa and Ve is Kubera Amsa. Some internal clash will be there, because, one will be spiritual (Ju) and other one Money (Ve). Check for Palana Devata: 48. Palana Devata will give lively hood/enough to live. 49. In D-1, check for Amk. In example chart Ve is Amk. 6th from Amk in D-9 shows the Palana Devata. In this chart, Ma & Me show Palana Devata. Also Ma & Me are linked with Ista-devata (12th from karakamsa (AK in D-9)) and Dharma Devata (9th from karakamsa). Pray to Lord Narasimha for over all success in life. Lesson #17 75 Check for activation of curses from the past life: 50. In general look for curses in the chart, when the person get laid- off or job loss for long time. 51. Dasa should be used for curses is Moola Dasa. 52.

Check for above curses in the example chart: 58. Curse of wife: There is no curse, because Ve and 7th house and 7th Lord are not afflicted 59. Curse of Mother: Ma afflicts 4th house and Sa afflicts 4th Lord and 4th house karaka is not afflicted, so there is no Mother’s curse. 60. Curse of Father: Ra afflicts Su 9th lord and 9th house. Its not very strong, because it has not afflict by 2 malefics. So there is a weak curse of father from past life. Father felt that, he was cheated because of Ra. This might have fructified when the native was young. Current dasa is Sa, and it is not involved in any curse. 61. When you see a curse, check how the curse has given: a. Ma will give angry curse, b. Sa will give sad/sorrow curse c. Ra & Ke will give shock curse 62. What kind of karma is Sa carrying from past life? Look for amsa of Sa in D-6, which is Chandra-Rekha, it is not bad at all, with out any obstacles. Lesson #18 Compiled by: Vijay K. Chitra Topics Covered: 1.

To see younger sibling’s spouse, do not look for 7th from LA, look for UL. a. In the example chart: Sibling ASC is Li and UL for this is “Cp” and Ke is placed in it. This will become ASC for the spouse. b. Ke in ASC gives spiritual or very stubborn person. Tough to understand the person. 17. If the LL is in 9th house, those people will be their own bosses.

Dasamsa Analysis. 2. Nakshatra dasas talked in detail. Key Points: Nakshatra dasas: 1. These are special dasas applicable only if some conditions are met. 2. There are some dasas which are applicable to ½ the humanity. If several dasas are applicable, then the one that is applicable to less percentage of people should be used. This should be given priority in such cases. 3. Dwi Saptati Sama dasa – 7th lord in ASC or LL in 7th. This should be seen only in Rasi chart. The probability is 1/12 + 1/12 – 1/144 = 1/6 – 1/144 is approximately 1/6. 4. Shasti Hayani Dasa (or Shasti Sama Dasa) – If Su is in LA. 5. Satabdika Dasa – If Lagna is in Vargottama. Vargottama means a given planet is in the same Rasi in both Rasi and Navamsa charts. 6. Shat-trimsa sama dasa: This is applicable for day time births in Su’s hora and night time births in Moon’s hora. Here we are talking about the D-2 hora chart. For daytime birth – check birth time w.r.t. sunrise and sunset and decide. It would vary depending upon the place. Even signs half affinity to Mo and odd signs to Su. Divide the sign into 2 parts. In case of even sign, the 1st half goes to Mo and 2nd half goes to Su. In case of Odd sign, 1st half goes to Su and 2nd half goes to Mo. In this chart, ASC is in Le at 6o in Le hence it is daytime birth in Sun’s hora. Applicable in this chart. 7. Ashtottari dasa: Applicable for day-time birth’s in Krishna Paksha and night time births in Sukla Paksha. Additional condition is Ra should be in trine or quadrant from ASC. 8.

It applies to some people who begin a big venture, like someone starting a jyotish parampara or starting a dancing school etc… which would last a long time. Cn is associated with Brahma, Li with Shiva and Pi with Vishnu. Cn is the sign of creation and Dwadasamsa lineage. 13. Parasara talks about chart even for Brahma, Manu and Prajapati etc... Mo was born on Kartika Purnima. This is to say that the meanings of Su and Mo to these charts have different definition applicable to paramapurusha from those of human beings. 14. Dwi-Saptati sama dasa is 72 years, sama is equal – all planets get equal period as against in Vimsottari planets get different periods. In this chart, applicable dasas are Dwi-saptati sama dasa (7th lord Sa is in LA) and Shat-trimsa sama dasa. In this case, Dwi-saptati sama is more rare than other, so use this. In case, if multiple dasas are applicable, give priority to whichever dasa has higher number of years. Ashtottari is 108 years, Dwadashottari is 116 years, Chaturaseeti is 84 years and Dwi- saptati is 72 years. 15. Vimsottari dasa tracks the state of mind. But the conditional dasas have specific indications. Dwi-saptati sama dasa shows 7th in ASC or LL in 7th. 7th lord is the consciousness of the desire (moving force behind the desire). That means, the native has strong desire and this dasa focuses on how those desires are fulfilled. For pursuit of desires use this dasa. This dasa may not accurately indicate marriage and so on… for that use Vimsottari. Example Chart 1: Chart Rectification: 16. Career Input for chart rectification. a.

A planet in Indra-amsa would give authority. It’s ability to give full authority depends upon the house it is in. 19. Career started in Ju-Su dasa and is run entire 9 years of Ve dasa. Ve is in Varuna amsa. Varuna is the ruler of the western direction and shows having lot of patience, dealing with people, being in business etc… 20. In Dasamsa, Ve in ASC in Li, in own house (very strong) with Su and Sa. In Sa dasa, native came to USA. Sa here would indicate some odd jobs. Li natural 7th sign shows diplomacy; Su shows bosses (Su debilitated, so bosses unhappy, moving etc…); Sa shows hard work; and Ve has to deal with all these people. 21. For a stable career, the Ve must have had strong influence on 2,6,10 houses being the artha trikona. In this case, Ve has an Argala on 10th house Cn, but nothing with 2nd or 6th houses. Hence, ASC in Vi (2m 55s earlier) makes more sense. In that case, strong Ve is in 2nd house with 6th lord Sa and would have Rasi Drishti on 10th house Me. 22. Any planet with Su is combust. The combustion is not as bad when Su is debilitated in Li. Ju and Ma are friends of Su. So, it is not a big deal for them as Army commander (Ma) and Priest (Ju) are good with King (Su). But, for Ve it is very bad. Ve is Watery sign, which evaporates with Su - Agni sign, where as Ju and Ma are Agni signs. 23. In case of Sa with Su or Sa transit on Su, Su is troubled. If Ra, Ke are close to Su it is terrible. In case of politicians if Su is eclipsed with Ra, Ke they could loose power. Su is the planet to give power. 24. Ve also gives a management.

Ra is in Sg, is 7th lord and karaka and has graha drishti on 9th house Ar. Hence it is very likely that the native could have come abroad. Ve antardasa because Ve in Vi is with 12th lord Mo. Hence Ve dasa gives Mo results. Pratyantardasa Lesson #20 85 lord has to show a particular event. Of the houses for foreign travel 9th house is most important. The 9th lord or the occupants of the 9th house becomes the main planet to give that result. 29. Badhakasthana – movable – 11th, fixed – 9th and dual – 7th house. Ar with Ju is also the Badhakasthana. Hence, he moved in Ju pratyantardasa. Ju is also the 8th lord – instability, anxiety etc… So, 8th lord in 9th has given the instability relating to travel. TP Analysis: Coming to USA. 30. See for 1985. Hora lord is Me. Me is 9th and 12th lord in 7th. All three houses are connected. So, irrespective of all the dasa, this year there is foreign travel. 31. See Sahamas. Sahamam means an important matter. See paradesa sahamam or Jalapatana sahamam for going abroad. For marriage, see vivaha sahamam. See the houses that these sahamas indicate. If the lords of these houses have a link with Ra or with hora lord in this case Me, then, there will be good chance this year. The Sahamams are defined for every chart. These are reference points indicating that matter. See the sahamams relating to the chart in display and not native sahamams. 32. In this chart (in Rasi TP), a. ASC is in Li. Jalapatana sahamam is in Le and Paradesa sahamam is in Cp. Le is Badhakasthana (11th for movable signs) and its lord Su is with Ra in 8th house, so there is a link between Jalapatana sahamam, badhaka (Su) and karaka (Ra). b.

As discussed in chart rectification above, Adjust the ASC to Vi. 37. In Dasamsa, Sa dasa is from 1984 to 1993. 38. Ra and Ke are indicators of high tech and computers. End of 1993, Native went into computer networking. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 86 39. 8th house indicates layoff, 3rd house is a short break. Ma in 8th house will have changes in career with sudden developments. 40. Native was unemployed from Sept 1992- Oct 1993 – unemployed. Oct 1993 – Ra-Ra-Mo dasas got him a job. 41. 6th lord in 12th gives Vipareeta Raja Yoga. Pratyantardasa has to be a perfect indicator of any event. 42. Mo in ASC gave a new beginning. And he moved into technology due to Ra. Ra in Indraamsa should have given him some stability and some influence. With the adjusted ASC to Vi, Ra in Indraamsa will not give full authority due to being in 12th house 43. Sa is in Yama amsa means it would be routine work, no passion at work etc.., Ra in Indramsa gave high tech work and Ve in varuna amsa gave interaction with people etc... These would not line up perfectly line up like this if we used Vimsottari. Lay off in Ra dasa: 44. Consider Ra in Le as the La and analyze. 45. Ma is in 8th house could give break, but during Ra Maha dasa, taking Ma is in trine – 9th house from Ra so Ma in fact gives him fortune. 46. 3 planets (Ve, Su, Sa) are in 3rd house.

Hence, 7th also will show break in service as 6th is connected to service in the 2-6-10 artha trikona. If 7th lord is connected to 3rd or 8th house, there can be a small or long break. 49. In this chart, Sa is 6th lord from original ASC in Vi and Sa is also 6th and 7th lord from Ra and is in 3rd from Ra in Le. Hence Ve giving Sa result will give the break in Ra-Ve period – which seem to have happened in 2001. 50. Currently Su dasa – Su in Indramsa. Su is 12th lord and is debilitated in 2nd house. 12th house debilitated is good. 51. 6th house is karaka for service and 6th lord is shows strong service. 7th lord Ju is maraka for 6th and is in 3rd house to give a small break. Also 3rd house is marana karaka sthana for Ju. In general 7th lord in 3rd is good because they are both of kama Lesson #20 87 trikona. But, Ju (as 7th lord) in 3rd is not good. Hence, business is not advised for him. 52. Marana karaka sthana is a death-causing house. For a. Su it is 12th - It is like placing a king to take up renunciation b. Mo it is 8th – Mo is the karaka for piece and has no enemies. 8th house of anxiety etc…, he is unhappy there. c.

Key Points: 1. In case of human beings consider the date, time and place of birth to cast the chart. In case of politicians, it is a very common practice that they carry several charts and hide the natal charts and no one really knows the accurate chart. But, they cannot hide the time of filing for nomination or taking oath etc. So, we use the time of filing nomination as the birth time. The place where he filed the nomination will be the place of birth. The time of filing is the muhurtha time. 2. At this time it is not a person, but a new candidacy is born. These are called “mundane” charts. 3. In mundane charts, all the divisional charts are not applicable; we use 6 or 7 vargas and what they stand for also changes. Any case, RASI chart is the most important. The meanings of the houses are still the same. But, you have to remember them top apply to a chart of a candidacy and not to a chart of a human being.

LL (Ju) is in 8th house from LA. So, it shows a setback in getting power. (GL is talked about in the next example) Example Chart 3: George Bush’s nomination for 2004. 8. ASC is in Ar. LL Ma conjoins 5th lord Su in 5th house is maharaja yoga. Conjoining of 1, 5 lords is a Raja yoga. But, if it happens in 1st or 5th houses, it is called Maharaja Yoga. 9. Also, see how close they are. In mundane charts, If they are very far they impact is not happen. We usually consider within 6 o, the raja yoga to be strong. Up to 10 o it is ok. Beyond 10 o, it may not be effective. 10. Another point to see is, check if they are going to get closer as the time progresses, the raja yoga may function. If they move apart the raja yoga will not happen. 11. In case of Su, Ma – If Ma is advanced, Su travels faster than Ma", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

In mundane charts Mo shows masses (mind of the masses). 13. Ra causes eclipse to Mo. Ra always moves backwards. When Mo is going to catch up with Ra in the same sign of LA, this eclipse and hence a setback in the very house of existence, it shows loss of popularity of his candidacy. But, since Ra moving backwards is moving away from ASC and Mo getting close to Lesson #21 91 ASC means that after a large setback, Mo with ASC will get the support of the masses back to him. 14. Ma with Su is combust. But, it really doesn’t matter since both are agni planets and Ma is not effected. In fact, even for Ju it is not bad, but the worst combustion is for Ve. With Me, it gives Budha-Aditya yoga (also called Vipuna Yoga) – the result is that the person is very intelligent. Not too close, if too close, Me gets combust. There are different opinions on this. Narasimhaji’s opinion is, this yoga gives result when they are very close. Me is the learning ability and Su being the Soul, the learning ability has maximum potential to learn from the Soul when they are close. This yoga is more important in D-10 or in D-24 than in Rasi. 15. When a planet owns 2 signs (Ma in this case) it gives the results of both houses, but gives the results of the stronger house first. 16. Badhakasthana - For Movable signs 11th house, Fixed signs it is 9th house and for dual signs it is 7th house. For Ar LA, Ra is Badhaka. Badhaka gives unseen troubles and is correlated with pisacha or peeta badhas. Since, Ra in this chart is in LA, there are inexplicable troubles for the native. The Bhadaka lord is called Bhadakesh. 17. GL – Gatika or Gati Lagna – shows the existence from the point of view of power. One important aspect is see which house GL is from LA. That house attributes indicate the source of power for that native. For ex, a. if GL is in 5th from ASC, then power comes from ability and popularity b. if in 8th house, power comes from", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

Take GL as the LA. Then Ma and Su and in 10th house are very well placed in karma sthana. 19. A planet is having association both with ASC and GL is called a “Yogada”. Association in this case is owning, occupying it or having a Rasi drishti. 20. Since, Ma is the yogada, war is the aspect that gets the native power. Ju in Vi is the Maraka. So, Ju (shows economy etc.) is not a good topic for power for this native. 21. If there are four or more planets consecutively occupying the houses, it is called grahaMalika yoga. (Include Ra, Ke for this). It shows some great achievement. The starting planet shows the trigger for this yoga. See the start and the culminating planets to give this yoga. For ex, Sa indicates hard work and Ke indicates (apart from Moksha in human charts) religiousness, headless terrorism (negative side) and conservativeness (positive side). Lessons on Vedic Astrology 92 Both Ra and Ke can show terrorists – Ra shows planners and Ke shows headless executors. Example Chart 4: George Bush. 22. LL in 7th or 7th lord in LA, use Dwi Saptati Sama Dasa – There is Raja Yoga between 1,5 lords. There is GajaKesari yoga (Ju-9L, Mo-LL conjoining). The yoga fructifies depending on how close the planets are. This gives a long lasting fame. It depends on how close they are. The way that the yogas may or may not function depending on the closeness is only applicable to mundane and other charts and not to natal charts. Ju dasa from 2000-2009 coincides with his fame becoming president. The peak of this yoga is in Ju-Mo dasa-antardasa in 2006. Ju is in maraka karaka sthana. Ju is 9th lord and gives Jupiterian and satwik dharma. Ju being in 3rd house is unwillingly choosing the path of aggression for fulfilling the 9th house responsibility of implementing Jupiterian karma. 23. Gaja Kesari yoga will give a long lasting fame. The effect could be to the extent that the native could be remembered for decades and might make it into history. That is how powerful Gaja Kesari yoga can be. 24.", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

Kala Sarpa Yoga and Kala Amrita Yoga- This happens when all the planets are helmed between Ra and Ke. Kala Sarpa yoga is highly problematic – may become like Ra – a thief, a scoundrel. Kala Amrita Yoga, Starts with Ra but ending in Ke will become saintly. Ra puts one in Bhoga marga and Ke puts one in Moksha marga. When either of these kala Sarpa/Amrita yoga is present, the other yogas may not function. Consider the advancement of planets to check if the planets are between Ra and Ke or not. Some people consider ASC and others don’t for checking the planets. Usually throughout life. Usually unto 40 years this yoga functions and then there will be some important events in life with which the native breaks out of this. a. Ra starting – then all planets and Ke ending – It is called Kala Amrita Yoga b. Ke first, all planets and Ra last – It is called Kala Sarpa Yoga. 26. Three malefic planets in quadrants from ASC forms Sarpa Yoga. Mo is usually not considered for checking this yoga. The results are the native will be unlucky and treacherous and in constant troubles. Makes them feel like a snake coils them. 27. Three benefic planets in quadrants from ASC forms Mala Yoga – garland around neck – Lucky. Lesson #21 93 Tithi Pravesha Chart: D-10 analysis 28. The hora lord or the ruler of the year is Me. 29. Me is LL in 7th house and having sama saptaka – aspecting Ve (5th lord in LA). Mutual aspect between LL and 5th lord is a Raja Yoga. 30. The hora lord is taking part in a Raja Yoga. Unlikely that he will leave the power this year. 31. Mo in sukla Paksha is benefic – Mo (8th lord) in 10th house indicates a setback, unexpected gains, tensions etc. So, the karma is does in society is having 8th house aspects. 32. Mo is in GL and having Rasi aspect on LA. So he becomes a Yogada occupying GL and aspecting LA. Me is also a Yogada in Rasi chart and is hora lord in D-10.

All the physical aspects are seen from the Rasi chart. But, Dasamsa shows the environment in which he karma is taking place. 34. Question: Why does he have so many strong enemies. Answer: a. Amk is Ve. This shows native’s soul b. PK is Ma. This shows the soul of followers and supporters of native. c. GK is Sa. This shows the opposite souls. Ra moves backwards. d. Two planets with same advancement get replaced. The 1st one will be occupied by second and the second slot will later be taken by some sthira karakas. Usually the replacement happens at the planets natural age. There will be a big change of personality at that time. Since these are happening in karmamsa, look D-10. Amk is in 6th from La in Sg. GK is Sa. Mundane charts, to see how different parties perform, one technique is to use karakas. For Democratic Party, most probable the planet is Sa. Color of Sa is blue, their party symbol is donkey and is all represented by Sa. Blue color people. On the other hand, Republican party, symbol is elephant (Ju). Color is Red (Ma). Ma and Ju is big money, big businesses etc. Ju shows conservative people. Also, if 2 karakas in trines, they work very well together. If they are in quadrants, there will be a lot of effort needed and they will not work well together. Also if karakas are in 6-8 or 2-12 relationships, they will not work well together. If PK and GK are in these houses, their souls will not be in harmony. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 94 In this chart the AmK and replaced GK (Ra replaced with Sa) are in trines and the enmity comes naturally. No effort needed. Example Chart 5: 2008 Tithi Pravesa chart of Algore Rasi chart. 35. Hora lord is Ju. Gaja Kesari yoga - Ju (25 deg) and Mo (7 deg) – far apart. 36. Yogas formed in this chart: a. 5th and 9th lord also forms Raja Yoga. b. LL Ma and Ju and Mo – all the trine lords are on the same axis. c.

What houses in a rasi chart show whether a person is a real saint or not. 2. Example Chart 1: Swami Jayendra Saraswati - July 18, 1935; 7:00 pm; 5:30:00 (East of GMT); 79E26 10N42. a. Analysis of dasa and antardasa indicate the arrest of Swamiji. b. Predictions about his release.

If naturally benefic planets such as Jupiter, Venus, Me etc., are in 3rd & 6th from AL, the person does not want to fight and he is not inclined materially. He is very gentle and restrained in public behavior. This combination is generally present in the charts of saints and mild natured people. 2. Malefic planets in the 3rd and 6th houses from AL are good for materially successful persons like politicians or businessmen. These people are perceived as bold and who hit enemies hard. If there are no planets in those houses, the nature of the signs (malefic or benefic) and the lords of the signs will give the results. The sign aspect on these houses will give the secondary results. See if there are any benefic or malefic planets in those signs. 3. If Ma is in the 3rd and Ju is in the 6th from AL, that person’s first instinct is to hurt his enemy, but he won’t. If Ju is in the 3rd and Ma is in the 6th, that person does not have the initiative to fight, but once he decides to fight he will finish the enemy. 4. For the matters of Dharma and marriage Su behaves like a benefic, especially if he is in a friend’s sign. Moola dasa and Vimsottari dasas: 5. To find when the results of various past life karmas are manifested in this life, look at the Moola dasa. This dasa shows the root of events from our past life. 6. In a saint’s chart, the 9th house and the karma the 9th lord carries is very important. For example if the lord of 9th house is in Deva (divine) Shashtyamsa, a high level of dharma will be granted to that person. And if the ninth lord is in Rakshasa Shashtyamsa the dharma that person follows is defined by a lot of negative Lesson #22 97 karma from his past lives. This dharma will be fulfilled in the Moola dasa of the ninth lord. 7. The placement of the 9th lord (from the rasi chart) in D-60 chart shows what karma is unfinished from the past life. 8. Atma karaka Kendradhi Graha Dasa shows the evolution of the soul in this life.(How you discover yourself, how you separate away from what the soul wants, what is happening from the point of view of the soul, etc.)", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

Count the number of planets in quadrants from Mo and LA. Whichever has more planets will dominate. 10. If ASC is stronger than Moon, that person is more individualistic and has a strong personality. He does not worry about the reactions of the world from his actions. If Mo is stronger, that person thinks more about others’ opinions of him. 11. ASC is that through which you act in the world, and Mo is that through which you react to the world (how you experience the world). 12. When there are 3 or more planets in a house, arrange them in the order of natural beneficence or maleficence. The most benefic planet will give the result of the most malefic planet, and vice versa. 13. Su based Vimsottari dasa is mainly used in Adhana charka (the chart that is cast at the time of conception of a child.). Using that dasa one can compress all the dasas to the next nine months to figure out what is happening to the soul in those nine months. 14. Tribhagi Vimsottari dasa shows how 360 degrees of the zodiac are mapped into 120 years of one's paramayush. This dasa shows when the Sahamas are activated. Sahamas: 15. Sahamas are the significant points in the zodiac. For each matter in life, there is one significant point defined. These Sahamas are used for calculating event-occurrence time. 16. For example, Bhandana Sahama is applicable to time the event of imprisonment of a person. Look at the longitude and the sign of that particular Sahama. The planets and the Nakshatra that are occupying that point are very important to time the event. When that particular point in Tribhagi Vimsottari dasa is activated, imprisonment may happen. Others: 17. The word “Panchanga” means five segments or limbs, namely, Tithi (lunar day), Vaara (week day), Nakshatra (constellation), Lessons on Vedic Astrology 98 Yoga (Lunisolar day) and Karana (half of a lunar day). The five panchangas are divisions of time to show the quality of time. The system of Annual Tithi Pravesa charts is based on Tithi. 18. Out of these five panchangas a. Tithi is of Watery nature b. Yoga is of Ether nature c. Vaara is of Fiery nature d. Nakshatra is of Airy nature", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

If a lord of any Arudha is badly placed from ASC then that Arudha is suffered. Lord of any Arudha pada placed in a quadrant or in a trine is good. That Arudha will flourish. 21. In the annual Tithi Pravesha chart, the hora lord is like the king of the year. Something important will happen in his dasa. But he is more powerful in his own dasa than in his antardasa of some other planet’s dasa. If there are any yogas involved with this planet, those results are also given. 22. Ra in 10th house from AL is bad. In his dasa, the person will be seen as a cheater or as a cunning person. 23. A malefic planet in 2nd from AL (especially if it’s a functional malefic) is bad. And benefic planets placed here will give the AL good nourishment to rise. Malefic planets can pull the Arudha down by the negativities they represent. 24. Don’t see lordship of Arudha Padas. See only lordship of AL 25. If 5th lord involves in a raja yoga, especially in a good house like 10th, that planet’s dasa will give great following. 26. Vipareeta raja yoga works only when a dusthana lord is in a dusthana either alone or with the lord of another dusthana. If he is with the lord of a benefic house then there is no Vipareeta raja yoga. 27. If LL is involved in any raja yoga, that yoga is more powerful. 28. In D10 if the ninth lord is in Agni Amsa, that person’s dharma is to transform people. 29. If it happens in a saint’s chart, that person will transform the people spiritually.

D1 - Strong Ju in ASC makes people diplomatic. Strong Ra is diplomatic too but for selfish reasons. 13. D1 - If Bhoga falls where in the house which has UL, marriage can take place during that Dasa/Antardasa. 14. D1 - 9th lord's Amsa (Check the amsa ruler of D60) shows the Dharma carried from the past life. 15. If the amsa is 'Soumya' or 'Amruta' it is very auspicious. 16. D9 - If Sa and Me are influencing ASC and/or the 7th house, homosexual tendencies are seen in the person. This is because Sa and Me both are Unisex planets. 17.

Key Points: 1. Out of all the zodiac signs, Pisces represents oceans and Aquarius shows mountains. Seeing Foreign travel in a chart: 2. 12th, 9th and 7th houses are important for foreign travel.12th house shows displacement from motherland. 9th house shows fortune in a foreign land and 7th house shows long travel because of a strong desire. 3. Badhakasthana lord can also give displacement. 4. For fixed signs(Ta, Le, Sc, Aq) Badhakasthana is 9th house. For movable signs (Ar, Cn, Li , Cp) it is 11th house and for dual signs (Ge, Vi, Sg, Pi) it is 7th house. 5. Persons born in fixed signs are very stubborn and rigid in their views. They have some sense of dharma to follow, and that dharma will give them trouble. So 9th house (house of dharma) becomes their Badhakasthana. D-4 (Charurthamsa): 6. This chart is used to see residence, properties or where one travels to etc. 7. In D-4 3rd house shows loosing or leaving home (12th from 4th). 8. If 12th house is involved in foreign stay, that person will miss his motherland a lot. If 9th house is involved he will prosper in foreign countries. 9. Badhakasthana lord shows inexplicable problems, worries or troubles. 10. If a person comes to a foreign land in the Badhakasthana or its lord’s dasa, it means that there are some problems or worries in the motherland, which make the person, leave his country. 11.

The strength of a raja yoga depends on how close the planets are in that yoga. If hora lord is the lord of 8th house or 12th house that year will give some problems. 15. Along with watery signs, signs owned by Sa and Ra (Cp and Aq) are important for foreign travel. 16. Paradesa saham and Jalapatana saham are also important for foreign travel. If these signs are associated with either 9th, 7th or 12th houses or their lords, there will be foreign travel during that year. 17. In TP charts, Narayana dasa gives better results than Vimsottari dasa. So it’s always a good idea to consider two or more dasas to make predictions. D-16 (Shodasamsa): 18. This chart is used to see vehicles, accidents, pleasures, comforts, discomforts, and mental happiness. 19. 6th and 8th houses show accidents. If any antardasa lord is in or connected to the 6th or 8th house from the mahadasa lord, there can be an accident in that antardasa. 20. If Ju and Ra are in the same house in an ATP chart, the native should be very careful regarding those house matters that year. If it happens in the 5th house, there maybe problems with children. 21. Ra with Ju is a combination for “manushya hatya” (killing of a person). A person corresponding to that house may even die. If it happens in 7th, it will be the spouse; in 4th, the mother. It is generally more serious if it happens in ATP chart. Ra hates Sun, Moon, and Ju. Though Su and Mo can fight back, Ju cannot. The negative energy of Ra gives rise to problems. 22. Any link between 6th and 8th houses in D16 is bad. If 6th lord is in 8th, don’t consider it as a Vipareeta Raja yoga. 23. If LL Ju is in 9th house in rasi chart, that is a great blessing. 9th house is the favorite house (house of protection) for Ju. That person", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

Wearing the gemstone of either 6th or 8th house is a very bad idea. 27. In D16, if ASC or 4th house has Ra and Ketu, or 6th or 8th lord in 4th house, there can be some inclination to accidents, especially in the dasa of those houses. D-6 (Shashthamsa): 28. This chart is used to see health, enemies, and litigation. 29. In ATP chart if a planet is associated with 8th house (both in rasi and D-6), that planet’s dasa will be bad for health. 30. When there are three or more planets in a house the most benefic planet will give the result of the most malefic planet. But exchange of results between these planets will not work if one of the planets is in its own house. That planet will end up dominating and the results won’t be given fully. 31. In ATP D-6 chart, if the 9th lord is eclipsed by Ra and Ke (especially in 8th or 7th house) that person will have some health problems in Ra dasa. Protection will be destroyed. Any efforts to cure him will not be on the right track, or any cure will not reach that person. Don’t advise any surgery in that period. Choose a better dasa. 32. Planets in 3rd house in D-6 will fight the diseases. 33. When you praise God without knowing the meaning of the prayer, there will not be complete results. When you are praising the gods by knowing the meaning, you are actually improving those good qualities in you. 34.

Vimsottari dasa tends to apply for everybody but only special dasas apply to certain charts. In smt. Subbalakshmi’s case Dwisaptatisamadasa applies because 7th lord Ma is in Lagna.

One should use these special dasas as a complete replacement to VD. Parasura suggested that one use these specific dasas but did not explain why, when and what to apply it to. 1. In Native’s case there is specific dasa applicable, so we use VD itself. However, one should note that the applicability of the dasa itself needs to be rectified. Using VD, native was married during Ju dasa and Ke antardasa. Looking at the Navamsa (D9) and taking Vi as ASC one finds that: 2. Ju is the 4th and 7th lord located in the 5th house of love and affection 3. Sa and Ju have a Parivartana, and because of that it is as if Ju is in the 7th house itself 4. Ju is also the Dara karaka 5. Ke is in the 9th house 6.

Native was a Civil Engineer to start with and then moved to software. Native is a Software Engineer only; he was never associated with any hardware.

Native getting a job during this period does make sense. 17. However, Native was not happy during that period doing what he was doing – he took a break to go back to school/university for his post graduation. He also had a strong desire to do something else like get into software. 18. Ju in the 9th house is very auspicious – 9th house is the house of your boss and also the house of protection. 19.

As a result of this combination one would recommend to Native that he actually work for somebody build a skill set and then become an independent consultant – this way the agenda of Rahu is well met.

Question: Why is Native learning Astrology so seriously in the past year? Answer: Native is running Ju MD and Rahu AD. He learnt Astrology so well that he rectified his own chart without blemish. In Ju MD and Rahu AD the bhoga experienced is the 8th house Ar. From Ju, Rahu is in the 11th house (Paka) and from Rahu 11th house is Ar (Bhoga). 8th house is occult knowledge – knowledge of the hidden.

Ju is in its house in Pi and this clearly indicates male but with Sa one cannot be sure. Dictum: Do not see the Rasi aspects when determining the sex of the child. Dictum: Ju with Ve would usually indicate female but if this happens in Pi, Ve would be exalted and represent a male. If Ju was with Mo one would predict a female child but if this happens in Taurus, Mo being exalted would represent a male. 32. In Native’s case, Pi is a male sign, Sa is a neuter but the tie breaker is Ju. One should always look at the house and the lord’s association to determine the sex of the child. 33. Counting the third house backward from the first child, the second child would be represented by Cp. The lord is Sa and he is with Ju and this clearly indicates a male child. Sa is located in Pi which is a male sign. We can confidently predict a male child. 34. In Native’s case, to get to the next child, counting 3rd house backwards, one has to cross over Rahu and this usually indicates the end. However, sometimes one may have one more child and then it ends. In Native’s case when one jumps over Rahu and gets to Scorpio, Su, the 5th lord in Rasi (D1) aspected by Ju seems to be strong enough to make this happen. But this is tough to predict. 35.

By using the general dictums one can determine that the immediate elder is a male, the one elder to that one is also a male, and the one elder to that person is a female – Me with exalted Mo is a male, Ma is next, Sa is next with Ve is female. 42. Native’s immediate younger sister died when she was two years old. Taking Scorpio as ASC one can notice that all 3 planets Su, Sa and Me are all in MKS. For Scorpio ASC 8th lord Me is in 12th from the 8th house, i.e., 7th house. 8th house represents longevity and the lord being placed in the 12th from it shows alpa-ayush. Usually if 8th lord is in the 7th or if 7th lord is in 8th then it is not good for long life. In addition, for Me 7th house is a MKS and this is particularly bad for longevity. For Le ASC, if Ju is in Aq. It is bad but, for this combination this is even worse because 8th lord Me is in the 7th house and in MKS. Dictum: Whenever a planet is in MKS in a chart, the house(s) it own(s) are affected tremendously.

Tip: The Jagannatha Hora software shows planets in MKS by right clicking the mouse on the chart and selecting the option ‘planets in MKS. Dictum: Each planets MKS is listed below - Lessons on Vedic Astrology 118 Su - 12th house; Mo - 8th house; Ma - 7th house; Mercury - 7th house, some classics also say 4th too; Ju - 3rd house; Ve - 6th house; Sa - 1st house; Rahu - 9th house; Ke does not have MKS; only causes Moksha. 43. The next sibling is a sister. The next sibling is 3rd from Li, which is Sg. Lord Ju is in Vi (Vi is a female sign). One has to Vi as ASC for this sibling. This sibling’s chart was discussed in an earlier class. This sibling’s ex-spouse is a Software Engineer. For determining the spouse of this sibling, take the Upapada (UL) from sister’s ASC. In this case this is same as AL, which is Sg. Taking Sg as ASC, 10th from Sg is Vi . The lord Mercury is in the 6th house Taurus with exalted Moon. Amongst 2nd, 6th and 10th houses, 6th is the strongest that too being the 10th lord. So Mercury is the deciding factor and naturally gives a logical person like a Software Engineer, Mathematician, etc. So, Drekkana(D3) passes the rectification test. Vimsamsa(D20) 44. Mo is the Atma karaka and 5th lord occupying ASC, i.e., Pi. Dictum: If AK is in ASC in any amsa that means god comes to that person in that amsa. That is a great blessing. 45. In Native’s case, in spiritual matters he is very fortunate. 46. For Sri P. V. R. Narasimha Rao, AK is in ASC in Siddhama (D24) and learning comes to him very easily. Dictum: If Atma karaka (AK) is in ASC in Navamsa (D9) one is usually a king according to Parasura. Essentially one is very blessed with regards to Dharma and will do very good karma. 47. In Native’s chart ASC lord Ju is in the 7th aspecting ASC and Mo is also the 5th lord of devotion.

Su would have given special attachment to Lord Shiva and/or Lord Sreerama. 49. Kula devatha for Native is Lord Veerabhadra – son of Lord Shiva. This seems very possible based on the chart. Ma is in the 2H – 2H shows Kula Devatha. Ve and Ma in Ar show a fiery deity. 50. Native is currently running Ju MD and this is very auspicious.

There will be a sudden rise during this period. From AL Sa is in the 9th – His image at work will be well protected. On the other hand, Ju the AL lord is 6th from it and this is not bad.

There are some general guidelines with each ASC but more than the face one should look at how fat and how happy one is. 60. Somebody has big eyes there will be a strong Venusian influence in the chart. Ve in ASC, owning the ASC. There are some things that always work but there are things that do not work. 61.

ASC has a strong Ma or Solar influence. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 120 63. If one sees Ju or Ve associated with ASC then the individuals have a lot of Kaffa in their body. They are well built, fat and stocky, have a thick oily hair. 64. People who are very emaciated have a strong vatta. 65. Vatta people are very thin, Pitta people are athletic and in between, Kaffa are fat. 66. Native has a lot of pitta and is going to see related problems. Ve and Ma are aspecting Ar ASC. Ve is influencing but strongest influence is Ma and Su, so there is some Kaffa because of Ve but Native is 80% pitta. 67. Ayurvedic Doctors if they perform the nadi, looking at the chart they can tell about the pitta. Ayurvedic doctors look at several lakshanas – Nadi, Heart, Urine, Stools, Coating on the tongue. If pitta is most dominant little bit of Sataavari, Gudichi, little of Brahmi in milk will be very good. Prakriti means inherent nature and Vikriti means changing nature in Ayurveda.

Native will have some health problems during this dasa but nothing severe and extremely bad. Ju is 6th lord but Rahu and Ke being in the 6th house would want to give health problems. 71. In Sa dasa, it is 8th lord in 9th house afflicting ASC lord and this is bad. Native should watch out during this period. Mo will try to protect but Sa will want to give problems. Mo is blood and Native should watch out for blood pressure. Native should not aggravate his mind either. If any blood related problems arise, Native should address them immediately. Dictum: High Blood Pressure is caused by pitta. Low Blood Pressure is a weakness and caused by vatta. Pitta related planets afflicting Mo give High BP but Vatta related problems give Low BP. In Native’s case, Sa is Vatta type and this will give Low BP and this might get worse. Native already has low BP and should be careful. Lesson #26 121 Kasinath hora (D2) 72. 2nd house is property.

So that means the 9th house protection is withdrawn. That can give a lot of anxiety. Not a very good financial position right how. 74. Sa is lord of 10th and 11th house in 12th and this is good because Sa is also the Badhaka. So, financial anxieties will be over and there will be relaxation and he will be spending more comfortably.

Native has done a commendable job rectifying his birth time. Sunrise definition There are three Sunrise definitions allowed in the software: 1. Edge of Su is on the eastern horizon 2. Center of Su is on the eastern horizon 3. The first easy of Sun-light hit the eastern horizon – this can very arbitrary based on weather conditions and not a good way of timing Sunrise. But Sanjayji uses this method while Sri P.V. Narasimhaji used the 2nd definition. When ASC and Su are exactly opposite to each other it is the beginning of the Sunset. When Su rises both GL and HL are exactly at the longitude of Su and then they move at various speeds – GL moves at the 5 times the speed of ASC and HL moves at 2 times the speed of ASC.

Darapada (A7) is the kind of people you associate with and it has Ra (mafia, undesirable, outcast, untraditional), particularly in Ra AD, it is more possible.

For example, 7th Lord shows application of intelligence towards relationships, native’s or native’s wife’s intelligence. Both are the same. Life force within native and others is the same. When you talk about house and house lords, you are talking about the truth. All these intelligences which seem to be different are one and the same. If you see them as different, then you are in the world of maya. 55. Narayana is sathya and Lakshmi is maya. When each person is created, certain intelligence goes within that person. House Lords show universal intelligence applied to that house. 56. To see the spouse in particular - see the arudha of 8th house from lord of 7th house and this is shown software as L2.

They are friends and the pregnancy will survive. 62. Next pregnancy does not make sense. 63. Note, when there are 2 marriages, the rules for seeing children are different. 7th house shows marriage and the gains (11H) from 7H show children a.k.a. 5th house. The even/oddity of ASC is the same. Since this is the 2nd marriage, 8th from 7th is the 2nd house, Le (odd sign, count forward) which shows the 2nd marriage. Gains from this marriage (11th house) are children thus, Ge shows the first child. Lord of Ge, Me is in Ar. Lagna of the child is Ar (Marsian) and/or Mercurian influence...

Example Chart 6: An astrologer's chart, Aug 7, 1963; 9:15 PM IST, 83E45, 23N13 India - discussed how the astrology knowledge came from his grand father. Key Points: 1. D24 – 2nd (application of occult knowledge, prediction), 5th (overall intelligence), 8th (occult knowledge you learn) and 11th (4th from 8th is learning occult knowledge) are the important houses for learning occult knowledge. 2. D24- Link b/n atmakaraka and 11th, means soul level connection for learning astrology. It is very important. 3. If you are checking somebody's status use Arudha LA. 4. D24 – 4th house is for grasping and 5th house is retention. Check their lords. 5. For political power, Su is the karaka. 6. In D10, 9th lord in the 10th house shows that the career comes with no effort, naturally. 7. Result exchange won't happen if Su is with Ke or Su is with Ra in the same house. However, if Ju and Su are in the same house, they do exchange their results. 8. If the antardasa bhoga falls in 8th house, in D10, shows big set back. 9. In D12, 4th house is the Lagna of mother and 9th is that of father. Grand father (maternal) is shown by 9th from 4th in D12. 10. D1,D9 - When A7 is in venusian sign, then that person may fall in love. Mo and Ve are karakas for love; 11. To see where the spouse will come from, check the 7th lord from Ve in D1/D9.

D9 - If the 7th lord from Ve is Sun, father arranges the marriage; Mo shows mother arranges it; Ma for brother; Ju shows grand father, Me shows uncle etc.. 15. In D7, if there is a Parivartana, then there is a change in the expected sex of the child. Ex: If by normal rules you get a girl, then due to the exchange, it would be a boy. 16. Ra and Ke in the 2nd house show that the prediction is based on intuition not based on solid logic. Lesson #29 Compiled by Palanivelu Topics Covered: 1. Introduction to Narayana Dasa (ND, rasi-based dasa. 2. Discussed in detail, the 3 types of analysis using Narayana dasa and antardasas. 3. Example chart 1: Discussed a lady's chart, Nov 11, 1965; 7:57 PM IST, Narsapur, AP, India 84E48, 16N34 for adoption. Key Points: 1. ND talks about the ultimate truth. 2. Brahma lives in Lagna. Shiva governs the 7th house. Narayana is either with Brahma (Lagna) or with Shiva (7th house). 3. Choosing where to start the ND is based on the following: a. more planets in that sign (ASC or 7th) b. Ju, Me, or the lord of the sign aspects (in ND, use only rasi aspects). c. Exalted planets in that house. d. Oddity of the sign and lord. If both are different, that wins. e. Look at the degrees occupied by the lord of the sign. The more the better. 4. For further progressions, follow the order below. a. For a movable sign (Brahma) follow regular order. (i.e. next sign, next to next sign etc..). b. For fixed signs (Shiva) take the 6th from that sign. c. For a dual sign (Vishnu), go by 1, 5, 9 (dharma trikonas), then 10, 2, 6 (artha trikonas) then 7, 1, 3 (kama trikonas). 5. One you decide on the starting sign, going forward or backward is based on the 9th from the dasa sign. If the 9th sign is odd footed (from the dasa sign), then go forward. Else go backward. (Ar, Ta, Ge, Li, Sc, Sg are odd footed; Cn,", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 123, "book": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01", "text": "Le, Vi, Cp, Aq, Pi are even footed signs). 6. Maximum duration for ND is 144 years. 7. 3 different angles to interpret the chart using ND are: a. See where Narayana is placed. See the current ND with respect to natal Lagna (ex: say Ar dasa is the 8th house from natal LA, of occult knowledge, working hard etc). b. See the progressed ASC and take that as ASC and analyze the chart. (Take the dasa sign as ASC if progression starts from ASC itself. Else take 7th from the dasa sign as ASC and analyze the chart). Lesson #29 135 c. Check the antardasa results using dasa pravesha chakra (DPC) for the particular ND of interest. Take DPC ASC as reference to check the antardasa periods. Check the influence of the ND lord and that sign's placement in this dasa pravesha chart to judge this dasa in general. 8. Narayana shows your efforts and Lakshmi shows the blessings. Lesson #30 Compiled by Palanivelu Topics Covered: 1. Discussion of a chart on Narayana dasa(ND) to check the Sg & Aq antardasa in Sg ND using period entry chart (dasa pravesha chart).

Key Points: 1. 10 lord in 8th, gives disturbance / instability in the career. 2. 10 lord in 11th, career will be good and lot of money will be made in that period 3. 6th lord debilitated and 10th lord strong, gives raise to Jaya yoga. Victory over enemy during the dasa/antardasa of these 6th and 10th lords. 4. 8th lord shows unexpected things. 8th house shows hidden things. 8th lord shows working hard. 5. Ra and Ma show electronics area of study. 6. 5th house in D10 shows recognition in the career. 7. 9th lord, 12th lord and badhakasthana show displacement / foreign travel. 8. 12th and 8th house can show spiritual aspects such as kundalini rising. 9. 11th house shows gains. 10.

Key Points: 1. Question: Does there have to be Ra/Ke in the 9H for foreign trip to happen during the period of the Narayana Dasa of the 9H sign? Ans: Not necessarily. The involvement of 9H or 12H and their lords with Ra/Ke is suffice. Ra is the karaka for the project of foreign travel. The house, say 9H, represents the project, the planet in the 9H represents the persons working in the project, the 9th lord is the manager of these persons. If the karaka (Ra) has sufficient control, or if the karaka is a good friend of the people-manager, then the project will be done successfully. This is true in Rasi and also in D-4. Puzzle Chart: 2. In D-10, 10H (Career) is empty. 10L Ve is weak being with enemy Ju, but forms Raja yoga as Ju is 5L. LL Su is in 5H (Abilities, Recognition). Overall, a successful person. 3. 6H has exalted Ma – service-type career likely. A10 (formal career) is in the 7H (desire) – business is also possible. But career is indicated by the strongest amongst the 2H, 6H and 10H. 10H is strongest being aspected by its lord Ve which is in Lesson #32 141 Raja yoga with Ju. Ve is responsible for entertainment-type career. Here is a similarity with Aishwariya Rai’s D-10 Chart. 4. The person who has 5L (fame/following) stronger than the 10L (achievement) will have a lot of fan-following/adulation much more in proportion to his achievements. 5L and 10L conjoining is good as it indicated that there is a link between the two aspects. 5. Ma is good in 3H, 6H and 11H. Ma is exalted in 6H. To see if this is good, see lordship. Ma is 4L (comfort) and 9L (fortune/dharma) – therefore yogakaraka. Hence exaltation is very good. Exalted 9L in D-10 indicates lot of easy luck, whereas debilitated 9L shows lack of protection and need", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

AL in Martian sign – possibly a leader in his field or go-getter/dynamic person. 7. Planets in trines to AL (Me & Su) will boost/protect the person’s image during their dasas. Ve/Ju conjunction is a good raja yoga aspecting AL by rasi-drishti, hence their effects will manifest in bettering the image of the person. More than graha-drishti, rasi- drishti is considered for the permanent influences on AL. 8. In D-9, planets in trine to ASC (Su & Ju) indicate talents/abilities. Su represents rhythm/music and Mo represents melody/singing. LL Mo is exalted. Singing or musical ability is prominent. To see if he writes his own lyrics, see if there is any Ve-influence (song/poem/imaginative writing) in the 3H. Me-influence shows prose /scholarly writing. 9. This person is Michael Jackson. He is fighting litigation at present. From Tithi Pravesha (2004-2005) Chart, will this person go to jail during this period? Hora Lord Ma indicated main events of the year. It is 5L and 12L placed with 9L Su and 7L Me in the 9H (Leo) – protection. Bandhana Sahamam is at the end of Cp; its lord Sa doesn’t have a strong connection with the 12th L or H. 10. From the Tithi Pravesha (2005-2006) Chart, Sa is Hora Lord, 6L and 7L in 12H in parivartana with Mo. Ra is very close to Bandhana Sahamam in Pi in 8H. Chances of imprisonment are there but are weak. 11. From the Tithi Pravesha (2006-2007) Chart, Hora Lord and LL Me is in 12H with 12L Su and Ve (Bandhana Sahamam Lord). There is a strong connection for imprisonment. This is similar to Swami Jayendra Saraswati’s chart. Here Su is likely to cause imprisonment. The order of maleficence is Ve<Me<Su. So Su can (but doesn’t have to) exchange its results with Ve. 12. In natal D-10 Chart, none of the conditional dasas are applicable. Use Vimsottari Dasa. Present Mahadasa lord is Me. Me is 5th from AL and hence enhances the image. Planets in the Lessons on Vedic Astrology 142 5H from AL give a boost to the image and in the 9H from AL protects/maintains the image. 13.

Narayana Dasa Analysis: 15. 3 Basic Principles of Analysis: a. 1st Principle: Judgment based on the activation of Narayana in the house of the dasa rasi b. 2nd Principle: Location of the Progressed ASC and judgment of the natal rasi chart from this Progressed LA c. 3rd Principle: Judgment of the antardasa from the Entry Chart. 16. Rasi Chart: Present Dasa is Cn in 3H. Narayana (in Cp) is activated. Ve is LL in Cn and shows existence/ health/ character/ wisdom. 6H shows enmity/ rivalry/ litigation/ struggle. 6H has Guru-Chandala-Yoga (Ju/Ra) and signifies trouble relating to that house. Ju-Ra in 7H – serious problem in marriage; in 9H – problem/misfortune regarding father; in 1H – poor development of intelligence/health etc. 17. Suppose for Ta-LA, Su-Me-Ju-Ra are in 1H. This is better than just Ju-Ra there. When Ju (priest) is afflicted with Ra (wicked person), prayer to Su (king) is advised; similarly when Ra afflictes Su, prayer to Ju is advised. Hence Su-Me conjoining Ju- Ra is better. Su-Me is also a Raja yoga for this LA. 18.

Next antardasa in Cp with its lord Sa in trines to it – not much difficulty in this dasa. Problems will resurface in 2006 period probably after appeals etc. 20. Question: Shall we consider bhoga for this chart? Ans: No. Consider bhoga only for Vimsottari Dasa system. 21. Next Mahadasa is Leo, having a good Raja yoga Su-Me (lot of following and support). Narayana is activating Su, Me, A8 (Mrityupada, hardship) and Leo sign which is 4th (sense of right direction) from La, and 12th from AL (fall in status).

Narayana Dasa of Divisional Charts, say D-10. For D-10, controlling house is 10H. In Rasi Chart, 10L is either Sa or Ra. Now come to D-10 and find stronger of Sa and Ra. By Sources of Strength rules, Ra is stronger. Ra is in Li; 7th from Li is Ar. Between, Li and Ar, Ar is stronger. Hence, Narayana Dasas of this chart start from Ar. As Ar is movable sign, Brahma progression is used. 9th from Ar is Sg (odd-footed) so the progression should have been in the forward direction. But because of Ke in Ar, it is backward.

The Sg dasa was very good because Sg is in the 5H (fame/recognition/following) with LL Su present. Next dasa, Sc and Cp were also good because of the Raja yoga and exalted Ma, respectively. Example Chart 2: 25. In D-24, present dasa is Li in 8H (occult knowledge) with Ju (significator of knowledge), A5 (scholarship) and A11 (actual gains). Hence, this dasa is a very important period for his astrological pursuit. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 144 26. 8H, 11H, 2H, 5H (i.e. all the kendras to the 8H) in D-24 are important for learning occult sciences like astrology. 8H = aptitude for occult, 11H (i.e. 4th from the 8H) = learning of the occult, 2H (i.e. 7th from 8H) = desire associated with occult knowledge i.e. predictions in case of astrology, 5H (i.e.10th from the 8H) = application of the occult knowledge gained. Example Chart 3 27. In Example Chart 3, present Divisional Narayana Dasa for D-24 is Sg in the 11H containing LL Sa. Also, 11H aspects 2H, 5H and 8H. Hence this is a quite good period for learning astrology for this native. However, note that the learning of occult, although usually happens in the dasas of the signs of the above houses, may also happen in other dasas. The above is a thumb- rule. To see this make sure that the D-24 ASC is correct. Example Chart 4 28. In Example Chart 4, present Divisional Narayana Dasa for D-24 is Cp in the 4H (Learning) with its lord and yogakaraka Sa – very good learning period. The location of Sa in Amsas and in Rasi- chart show the direction learning goes. Do not neglect the use of Rasi Chart in combination with the Divisional Charts. Rasi Chart shows the physical manifestation of any event. In the Rasi Chart, controller of occult knowledge is 8L (Ma) in the 11H, debilitated & retrograde, hence having Neecha-bhanga (akin to exalted status) is also afflicted with Ra. Sa here is the controller of scholarship being the 5L.

Hence, we can conclude that there will be strong learning in the above- mentioned areas during this dasa. Mo in Rasi Chart is 11L and is in D-24 Chart thereby also directly influencing the learning. 29. For the next Dasa i.e. Sg, in D-24, the lord Ju is strongly placed with Su and Ma in the house of protection (natural 9H is governed by guru). There is a possibility of finding a very good guru when this dasa commences. 3H is also the house of writing and communication. Hence there may be some kind of writing. 30. D-24 is not only the chart of learning a particular subject. It is also the chart of evolution and maturity. The seed is the 12H – ‘giving up’ i.e. evolving. 31. The native has also starting learning astrology and homeopathy in the Vi dasa of D-24. Vi has A2 and A8. A2 is the manifestation of use of knowledge, e.g. making predictions and A8 is manifestation of occult. Hence this can be thus understood. Lesson #32 145 32. AL is the only thing that is true in this illusory world of maya. AL is the overall image that is projected by the native in the world and not merely something that is arbitrarily made up in people’s mind. For example, in D-10, the AL is in Pi (fertile minded and intelligent) with debilitated Me (debilitated – hard-working). Hence, at the work place the native is viewed as an intelligent but hardworking person. In D-12 (parental relations), the AL is in Le with Me-Ra – intelligent but demanding (Le). The rasi drishti given by Ju, Mo and Sa also shows the various other influences. In each divisional chart, there is a particular placement of AL and there are various planets that influence it. This shows that in each areas of the life, there are different influences, which may also change with respect to time. Lesson #33 Compiled by Sourav Chowdhury Topics Covered: 1.

Lord of Ar is 8H, hence in this case 8H results (i.e. the result of the house containing the Dasa Lord) again may also be given. If there are planets, which are aspecting the Dasa rasi, they can also give their results during the period. Hence, several results are possible in Ar dasa itself. 2. Also for example, if Le is the running dasa, then 12H results can be given as Le is in the 12H. Additional results that are possible are: 10H (as Le is 10th from AL), 7H (as its Lord Su is in 7H), result of Ke, result of 3H (as 3L is Ke), results of Ju, Ve, Ma, Me and Sa (as they aspect Le by rasi drishti). Thus again a number of results can occur in Le dasa. There are clear rules to find out which result is experienced in which part of the dasa. 3. To prove the point further, Cn is the second dasa and is in the 11H. Hence during this dasa, there could have been gains. As 11L Mo is aspecting it by rasi drishti, there may be some gains related to food business or nursing business (Mo significations). Again, Mo is in the 6H of enmity and also afflicted by Ra. Hence some enmity may also be experienced. Whether the enmity is related to gains is a different issue, but the fact that there is a possibility of enmity is clear. Suppose, the 4 L or 7L Ju is placed in Cn, there could be gain related to 4H and 7H (home/car/wife etc) or relationship with the spouse may be harmonious (as Ju in Cn would be exalted). 4.

If Dasa Rasi is Sirshodaya, the result of the sign comes in the first slot, in case of Prishtodaya, the result of the sign comes in the last slot and in case of the Ubhayodaya the result comes in the middle slot. c. If the lord of the Dasa Rasi occupies a Sirshodaya or Ubhayodaya Rasi, then the lord will give its result in the first available slot after the Rule (b) is executed. If, however, the Dasa Rasi Lord is in a Prishtodaya Rasi, it will give its result in the last available slot. d. The remaining results (results due to the association/aspect to the Dasa Rasi) will be given in the remaining slot. For example, if the Dasa Rasi is Sirshodaya and its Lord is placed in a Sirshodaya Rasi, then the sequence of results will be: 1st Slot – results of the Dasa Rasi, 2nd Slot – results of the Lord of the Dasa Rasi, 3rd Slot – results of the conjunction/aspects to the Dasa Rasi. e. Consider the slot which is to give the results of the various associations (conjunctions/aspects) of the Dasa Rasi (see “d”). Suppose there are ‘n’ number of planets (counting Ra and Ke if appropriate) that are aspecting/conjoining the Dasa Rasi. Then divide this slot into ‘n’ equal parts. Each such part will give result of one of the ‘n’ associating planets. For example, in the Example Chart 1, Ar is the present Dasa Rasi. Ar is Prishtodaya Rasi and its lord Ma is occupying Ar itself. Hence the sequence of results are 1st Slot – results of all associating planets (i.e. Ve, Sa, Ma, Me, Ke, Mo, Ra i.e. n = 7), 2nd Slot – results of Mars, 3rd Slot – results of Ar. Therefore, divide the 1st Slot into 7 equal parts. Because the antardasas are equal in length, each Slot consists of 4 antardasas. So the first 4 antardasas i.e. April 1995 through April 1999 constitute the 1st Slot. Results of Ma will be experienced in the middle four antardasas or April 1999 through April 2003. The last 4 antardasas constitutes the 3rd Slot and gives the results of Ar.

Hence, the first quarter goes to avastha, second quarter goes to yogas, third quarter goes to houses it lords, and the last quarter goes to the results of the occupying house. Note: (a) Here only natural malefic/benefic nature is to be considered. Me is malefic or benefic depending on its association with malefic or benefic planets. Mo is benefic if it is waxing (sukla paksha) and malefic if it is waning (Krishna paksha). (b) If the entire Maha Dasa period is only one year or so long, then sub-sub-division may not be done. In such cases, Tithi Pravesha will give good judgment with perhaps better precision. Example Chart 1 6. In this chart, the Sg dasa ran from April 1985 through April 1995. Sg is Prishtoodaya Rasi and its lord Ju is in Li, a Sirshodaya Rasi.

Whatever natal chart promises, the dasa will only modify it and not completely change it. 8. The middle one-third or 2nd Slot goes to associating planets of Sg. Here only Su is aspecting Sg by rasi drishti. Su has 4 years to give its results. Using the same rules as before, we can further sub-divide into four equal parts or quarters. Su is malefic. Hence, a. first quarter goes to avasthas (here Su is in a Jupiterian sign but Ju is not placed within three sign-range from Su. Hence Su is moderately well placed. Consider three kinds of avasthas based on – age, alertness and mood.

In fact during this period, the native stood first in his class by a huge margin. b. (ii) Second quarter goes to yogas of Su. Su is subjected to papa-kartari yoga. Also Su is subjected to Bhaskara Yoga (from Mo, Su in 2nd, Me in 3rd, Ju in 9th) – wealthy, learned of sastras and astrology. Hence, this period also indicated good learning. Su is also very closely afflicted by Gulika. When a malefic planet is aspecting the 4H, there can be loss of mental peace. This was a period of bad health for the native. c.

During this period, the native was making arrangements for going abroad for higher studies. d. (iv) The last quarter Su will give the results of the house he occupies. Here it is 7H or Badhakasthana (House of Obstruction). 7H and 9H are houses to be considered for going abroad, 9H is for flourishing abroad and 12H is the house for settling abroad. Apart from these the Badhakasthana is also an important house for going abroad. For Movable Signs (Ar, Cn, Li, Cp) the Badhakasthana is Lessons on Vedic Astrology 150 11H, from Fixed Signs (Ta, Le, Sc, Aq) it is 9H and for Dual Signs (Ge, Vi, Sg, Pi) it is 7H.

During this period, the native traveled from India to US for studies. 9. The last one-third of the Mahadasa period is taken up by the sign, Sg/4H. By what is known to me, the tradition doesn’t specify how, if at all, to subdivide this period pertaining to the sign. But we need to see a. the nature of the sign (ex. Satvik/Rajasik/Tamasik or fiery/ watery/.. etc) b. what house is it from ASC and AL (4th from La- sukha; 2nd from AL) c. what rasi aspects are there on the sign (here Sg is aspected by Pi, Ge, Vi). 7H aspect can show marriage. 10H aspect can show start of career. La aspect can show that the native takes good care of health. 10. Let us look at the next Mahadasa, Ar. Ar is Prishtodaya and its lord is also in the same rasi. First one-third of the Mahadasa or (1st Slot as we have been calling it) is taken up by associations of Ar (namely 7 planets that are conjoining or aspecting it by rasi-drishti). The next one-third or 2nd Slot will give results of the lord Ma. The last Slot will take up results of the sign itself. 11. The first slot is divided into 7 equal parts or about (48 divided by 7", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

This is based on a traditional view point. Another view point is to consider the relative strengths of Ra and Ke (based on occupying signs and associations they have) and choose the order between Ra and Ke. Each of these 7 planets will bring in their impacts on the Ar sign. Results: Mo – The11L placed in 6H and aspects Ar/8H. Therefore, Mo is bringing the 11H results to 8H through 6H – i.e. bringing some kind of gains to the 8H by overcoming of obstacles or through service. The native went to Korea for a few months on service and then decided to come back to the US and after changing a couple of jobs, found a suitable one. Ma – 8L is in own house, hence a very good period. Being 8H (changes) there were certain changes (getting visa to US etc) for the good. The native also had a child, shown by A5. Sa – Debilitated 5L and 6co-L in Ar, although there is Neechabhanga. 5L in 8H shows lot of scholarship in occult studies, anxiety due to children, own health problems. 6L in 8H can show accident.

There are also negative yogas also; Ma is a malefic planet and is afflicting the trinal lords. To see this effect note how close these trinal lords are. Sa is closest to Ma and Vipareeta Raja Yoga fructified and dominated. Suppose Me is very close to Ma; then problems related to health and career could have occurred. Moreover if Badhaka Lord (here Ju) associated with 8L or 9L, the person can settle abroad. During this period the native received Green Card. c. Third quarter goes to house lorded by Ma. Ma is 3L and 8L. 3H is 12H from 4H; hence 3H can show a big investment (i.e. expenses) for the 4H (vehicle/house) etc. Ma is also the karaka for this significance. 3L and 8L placed in a dusthana shows good results corresponding to these houses. There were changes in the job and instabilities in general and the native moved into a new house. d. Last quarter goes to the house Ma occupies. Here Ma occupies 8H.

We know that a malefic planet in the 3rd or 6th from AL is good where as a benefic there is not good (materially speaking).

Strong candidates for giving marriage are: Venus, Ke ( for growth of family), Upapada Lagna (UL), 7th house, Darakaraka (DK) and ASC in D9 chart. If you see the confluence of the above, then marriage is likely. 2. Ju, the DK, the variable significator of spouse. In Dasamsa, DK represents colleague or business partner. Ju is connecting UL and LA. 3. Sg or Li are the likely dasas based on the above criteria. Since Sg comes very late, Li is a stronger one. Ar and Le are also likely. 4. To get married, pray to the lord of UL (in D1) and before breaking the fast pray to the 2nd lord from UL (in D1). 5.

The middle 1/3rd is of Sa (2000 September till 2003 May). Sa is Badhaka in this chart. Middle 1/3rd is not good. 3. 1st 1/4th will be of his state (avastha) - Sa is in his enemy's house so he will not give good results. Sa is occupying the house of ability (5th) and hence spoiling it. a. If Sa is retrograde, it represents strong Karma from the past life so it comes with great effort. In that case, the person will put in lot of effort in that area. b. Ma is retrograde and debilitated in Rasi. So that is Neecha Bhanga. If the same Ma had been exalted in Navamsa then it is not that good. c. 2nd 1/4 will be of yoga of Sa - There is a Sa-Chandra Yoga. Provided there are other combinations then this combination gives Sanyasa. Sa rules over Mo (mind). d. 3rd 1/4 will be of the houses Sa owns (10th and 11th) -- This is relatively better period.

Using Standard rules of Narayana Dasa: 16. Take Virgo as ASC (taking dasa rasi as LA), Ra is in LA, Ju is in 10th house and having exchange with Me hence it is considered good. 17. For benefics being in Quadrants/trines from Dasa sign is good. 18. For Malefics being in 3/6/11 is good from Dasa Sign. 19. Sa in the 12th house from Narayana Dasa sign is bad.(only when taking Narayana Dasa sign as ASC and judging chart). 20. Sa is bad in this chart. Mo is in the 6th house.

If Ke is in the sign, he wants to go reverse or the opposite direction. He doesn’t mind fixed, movable or dual sign. Software automatically does this.

In case of India, there is no controversy but in case of several other countries, there is no exact time available. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 164 7. The paramayush for human beings is 120 years. This is in Kali Yuga. This changes in every yuga. 8. Hence, instead of depending upon the birth time of a country, which is so questionable, there are a few techniques suggested. There are several calendars – lunar calendars starting from different reference points etc. There are different solar calendars, which have mesha masa, vrishaba masa, mithuna masa and so on. Some people use the sunrise time or noon time where Su is to know the month of the calendar. Solar/Lunar Calendars: (Amantha Calendars) 9. Why is Su very powerful at noon time – This is because he is in the 10th house or karma sthana or the Indra sthana. That is why it is very powerful muhurtha. Also called Abhijit muhurtha. Su in 10th house being a strong muhurtha is more like a thumb rule, but is not absolute since, Su as a 8th lord in 10th house is not good. 10. In Indian calendar motion of Su is not arbitrary, he is at the same degree and in the same Rasi on the same day every year where as its is not guaranteed in a western calendar. 11. For kali Yuga, Cp is considered very important. For Solar calendars, Su entering Cp (at Makara Sankranti) a new chart can be cast for the capital of the country. Similarly a chart can be cast when Su enters Ar. A new chart can be made when Su enters the Ardhra Nakshatra (6o in Ge) Consider the country capital for these charts. This chart is used for meteorological purposes. Some people cast Ashada-sukla pratipada chart. 12. In Lunar Calendar (Some lunar, since we consider all Su, Mo and thither), When Su, Mo exactly together it is Amavasya, then Sukla Paksha starts. When Su and Mo are exactly 180o opposite it is Purnima and then Krishna Paksha starts. The names of the month are given depending on the nakshatra where Su, Mo conjoin in every Rasi. Su. Mo conjoining in Pi is when Chiatra masa starts. Chaitra sukla pratipada chart is used for general happening sin the country. 13.

Chinese calendar is similar to Indian calendar. They consider Su-Mo conjoining in Cp – Magha-Sukla pratipada. 16. Cp is important for Kali Yuga – since, it is owned by Sa, Ma exalted and Ju is debilitated. Lesson #36 165 17. SU entry into Ar is a political chart – shows political happenings at higher levels. Su entry into Cp is also political chart but for low- level masses. 18. Su-Mo conjoining in other Rasi signs may show other aspects of the country. Suklanta Calendars: 19. A new month starts when a new moon occurs. This is called suklanta as it ends (not starts) with Sukla Paksha. Starts with Krishna paksha. 20. When Su in Ar and Mo in Li is where New Year starts for people in Orissa and in Tamilnadu. 21. Full Moon day is considered important for spiritual events since, Mo is mind and 7th from Mo is the desire of the mind and when Su in 7th opposite to Mo, it is the desire of the soul. Hence it is good time for spiritual events. All full moon calendars focus on spirituality. 22. Performing spiritual pursuit in seashores, middle of ocean, in caves, on mountains may have special effects. At least in seashore it makes sense as, In narural zodiac, a. pi shows the watery places, middle of the ocean, rishis, prison, hospitals, seashore, all associated with water, liquid, and bandhana etc. b.

A8 shows the tangible aspects of the 8th house like obstructions, tensions, anxiety etc… So, the difficulties one goes through when the native moves to a new place and so on will be explained from A8. But, for green card, its not mrityu pada, but it is bhagya pada (A9 – Arudha of 9th house of fortune) that we should consider. 73. So, 9th, A9 and12th are the important factors for seeing foreign travel. Chaturthamsa (D-4) Analysis: 74. Lagna is in Vargottama. Varga means division Uttama means top or excellent. 75. Dasa to use – using Satabdika dasa since ASC is in Vargottama in Navamsa. 76. In D-4 ASC is in Ge. 77. Rectification of D-4 chart: e. Events - Came to USA in June 16, 2000 78. 7th, 9th, 12th and badhaka sthana are important for seeing foreign travel. Ju is the badhakesh (7th lord for dual signs). Ju is with Ra (karaka for going abroad) and Ra is also the 9th lord in the house of travel itself (3rd house). 79. Both Ju and Ra can give the result. But, Ju seem to have ended up giving the result. In general Ju-Ra (Guru Chandala yaoga) is a bad yoga. Ra stands for adharma and Ju stands for dharma. So, when they are together", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

So, the travel seem to have happened in Ju-Me dasa. 82. 3rd house can be a short travel also. But the bhoga for Ra-Me is in 3rd house itself where Ju, Ra are, so the travel in this period. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 180 83. Sahams work well in annual charts. Don’t look at them in natal charts. Tithi Pravesa chart for D-4 for year 2000. 84. Native is born on Ananda nama year, Vaisaka Amavasya with 46.47% left. So, 12 Jan 2000, 8:12:40 AM is when the annual chart for 2000 starts, when Amavasya with 46.47% left. 85. Hora lord is Mo – Mo is the ruler of the year. Mo will show the important events in the year. 86. In Rasi chart Mo is in 12th house. Being in 12th hose, Mo can give some displacement. 87. In D-4, Mo is 8th lord in 9th house of bhagya. Ra, 3rd lord who can give travel is in 8th house. So, in persuit of fortune in a far away land, the native goes through some instability as far as the residence is concerned during this year as Mo is the ruler of the year. So during this entire year during Ra dasa, he could have lot of instability. 88. Jala Patana Sahama is in Vi. Paradesa sahama is in Ar. If the Paradesa sahmam or Jala patina sahamam does not have a link with 9th house, 9th lord or , 12th house, 12th lord or badhakesh, then it is unlikely that the native will travel doing that year. 89. In this chart, annual TP of D-1, the paradesa sahama is at 9 Ar 52. Ar has 9th lord Sa and 7th lord Ju (also the badhakesh). Hence, there is a good chance that the native will go abroad. 90. This happened during Ra-Ra dasa. Ra is the karaka for foreign travel. He is 9th lord in Rasi chart and hence he can give the result even if he is not in an important house in the chart. 91.

Sa AD can give this result. Sa is 9th lord and is in 4th house of residence. 94. A malefic in 4th house can give residence in a far away place. Also, Sa has an argala on A9 and Sa has graha Drishti (a desire) on A9. Due to desire and argala he is capable of giving the result. 95. Software took the Ra as 9th lord in calculating A9 since Ra is stronger than Sa in this chart as Ra is with more planets (Ju) and is stronger. Also, Sa is the co-lord of the 9th house and having argala on the A9 can give the result. Lesson #39 181 96. To see PD, even that is too long like 2 years. So we see the current TP chart. Tithi Pravesa chart for D-4 for year 2004: 97. Hora lord is Ve. Ve is 6th and 11th lord. 98. Presently running Ju dasa and next is Ra dasa. In Rasi chart Ju is in 9th house, basically showing more dharmic work in this period. 99. In D-4, Ju is Bhadakesa and is in 6th house with A2 and A8. This shows that anxiety etc. related to dharmic work, but nothing in particular to green card. Tithi Pravesa chart for D-4 for year 2005: 100. This year starts on 6 June 2005 at 3:43 pm. 101. Hora lord is Ju. ASC is in Cp. Ju is 3rd and 12th lord in 3rd house with Ma. Ra is in 12th house. Ju also is Ra’s dispositor. 102. Sa is in A9. So, don’t jump to Sa dasa and say that the green card can be in Sa dasa. A9 is just one of the factors for green card and not the only factor. Sa in this is LL and his agenda is new beginning and shows motherland, but not with green card. 103.

Which dasa this can happen? 105. Ra or Ve are very good candidates. Ve is in 12th from AL – This can make people think that the native has left the motherland for good – That means the native has got a green card or permanent citizenship. Ve dasa runs from June 2005 to September 1, 2005. It should happen before that. TP analysis of D-24: 106. Hora lord Ju is in 4th house exalted and gives dharma- karmadhipati yoga (Ju-9th lord and Sa-10th lord). This shows the native is going to do good karma related to learning. 107. Ju is lord of AL and Sa is lord of Bhagya Pada. This combination is very good. Ju-Sa alsy gives Brahma yoga and is an excellent year for persuing traditional learning. TP analysis of D-10: 108.

This makes the person be straight forward, honest and forceful. Also, Su is in Yama amsa – Straight forward. Su gives the results in a solar way – Authoritatively. Le is the sign of authority. The native will be very assertive in Su dasa. Mo will gives the results in a Lunar way – not with authority. Su is also in A10 with GL. A10 shows the workplace and GL indicates a kind of promotion if the birth time is correct and D-10 is rectified. Su in A10 can give a better change of job. 112. 6th lord in 6th gives Harsha yoga – cheerful – overcome obstacles easily or not have any obstacles etc..

Ju shows Jagannath. So, chanting Jagannath astakam or something of that sort and visiting Jagannath temple during this time will benefit the career. Transits: 116.

Jaimini’s Sutras – are codified, terse and cryptic. Slokas are not to be read and interpreted as written. 3. But, these have been codified in a numerical format - encryption and compression together. 4. What is that encryption and compression? – Katapayadi scheme. 5. Take letters ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Na (and so on) - Assign values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. Split the word into individual letters and write the corresponding numbers below them. Now, reverse the number obtained and divide the result by 12. Remainder gives the target house which Jaimini is talking about (for more details, refer Jaimini Upadesa Sutras by Pt Sanjay Rath) a. For example, “Labha” is the 11th house, using the \"katapayadi\" scheme, we decode it as “La bha”. 4 => reverse => becomes 43 => divide by 12 => remainder = 7. Jaimini is talking about the 7th house. b. Idea was to keep the knowledge safe from people who could misuse it. Now, the trend is to distribute it. Hence, it was codified.

Tom Dellis speaks about his research of 15 years. Tom described a very interesting speech on a mathematical algorithm to generate ellipses for each of the planets. All planets are moving in this elliptical cycle. When moon’s node hits the plane of the vernal equinox, events will happen. He has been able to predict events in the stock market as a result of using these algorithms. For more details, please write to Tom. Lesson #42 Compiled by: Palanivelu L.M Topics Covered: 1.

Key Points: Puzzle chart data 1: Finding the actual marriage date among the above four dates: Using Vimsottari dasa: 1. Since the 7th lord is in lagna, let us use Dwi-saptati sama nakshatra dasa. 2. To see marriage, spouse use see Navamsa chart. Ve is the karaka for marriage. The planets associated with ASC and 7th house give marriage. 3. Now taking Ra maha dasa (1994 April to 2003 April) and check it’s placement in D9. Ra is with Ve, the karaka for marriage. When 2 planets are together they exchange their results as long as they are not inimical. Ra gives Ve’s results. UL and A7 aspect this sign, shows the actual tangible marriage 4.

Ma is the 7th lord, so likely. So Jan 26 and May 9th are likely. 5. Ma AD can’t give marriage as it’s with Su and it will give Su’s result. There is also an exchange b/n Ma and Sa in D9. Because of this Sa will give Su’s result. Ma will give Sa’s results and Su will give Ma’s results. So, Mo and Me Antardasa are likely to Lesson #42 193 give the results. Ju Pratyantardasa is likely to give marriage due to its exchange with Mo. Now analyzing using D9, ND: 6. Is Vi likely to give marriage? Yes, because the Vi sign is being aspected by UL. In general Ve and Ke are capable of giving marriage. Ke gives the lineage, parampara. Also the lagna and 7th house dasa rasi can also giving marriage. 7. At the time of marriage if you see only Ke active in the dasa sign, it means that the person is getting married for the purpose of growing the lineage. On the other hand, Ve shows for the sake of love, kama etc... 8. Let us look at the antar dasa. We can rule out Cp AD (Aug 17, 98), because it has nothing to do with all the above mentioned significations. A8 there shows problems in marriage. 9. Let us use 3 part rule. Vi is a srishodhaya rasi so the sign gives result in the 1st 1/3rd. 2nd 1/3rd is Me. Last 1/3rd is by planets aspecting and occupying the sign Vi. We know that the marriage here is given because of the occupants and aspects. 10. We have to divide the last 1/3rd (Jan 99 to Jan 2000) by the 5 planets aspecting and occupying Vi. Now arranging from descending order, we get Ve, Mo, Me, Ra and Ke. From this Me’s period Aug 22, 99 sounds possible. We’ll have to confirm it with other techniques. 11. The conclusion is that this person would have got married in May 9th, 1997.

Example Chart 2: Lessons on Vedic Astrology 194 Analysis of the financial situation using D2 – Kashinatha Hora chart: 16. For looking at finance in hora chart, Narayana dasa is the best dasa to see the results. Vimosattari is not very focused in hora. 17. Current D2 dasa is Le (from 1996 June to 2005 June). First 1/3rd gives the result of the sign, Le. 2nd 1/3rd is given by lord Su. The last 1/3rd result will be given by the occupants and aspects. 18. Focusing on the last 1/3rd part. There are 4 planets aspecting & occupying. In descending order, SU, Me, Ju and Sa. So from Sep 2004 to June 2005, the Sa’s results will be given. Sa is the 6th lord of hard work and 7th lord of desires, placed in marana karaka sthana. No a good period. Finance will be very tight. 19. Next dasa is that of Vi. The first 1/3rd result will be given by the sign itself. It is the 2nd houses of resources. In D2 chart, if there is an exalted or debilitated planet, he will make lot of money. If exalted it gives money easily. If debilitated, you have to work hard to get it. Checking from AL reference is very important in D2. Here Vi is in the 10th house of karma. So you’ll be very busy and busy in the society. Hora lagna is the actual shows wealth and the actual. Gati lagna (GL) shows the power and influence. Since Ve is the lord of both GL and HL.

So the first 1/3 result is given by Vi sign, the next 1/3rd is given by its lord Me, which is also in Sirshodaya sign. The first and 2nd 1/3rd are very likely to give a job, if not employed earlier. In D10, the dasa of LA, 5th and 10th sign are very important to get the job. Me is involved in a nice raja yoga with Sa in the 2nd house. This raja yoga will fructify in the second 1/3rd portion, when dasa lord Me yoga has to give its results. Me here is a malefic because it's with the malefic Sa. 2010 and 2011 seem very prominent. 5. Let's see the 2010 TP chart for any special events. Hora lord, ruler of the year is Ma. Here in D1, hora lord and LL are together to give a nice yoga. AmK and AK give a nice yoga too. Lesson #43 197 This 12th house yoga means he may be attached to that fructification and he has to make some compromise involved etc. 6.

Ma or Ju periods are likely to give good results. 7. Let's come to the current period TP of 2004. Mo is the hora lord. In D10 Gaja Kesari yoga in ASC shows long lasting fame. Mo is the 3rd lord of break and Ju as 8th lord of retirement do not favor getting a new job. 8. But they can give a good work, which will give fame later.

House of break/ vacation, initiative. 3rd lord in 3rd house means the initiative he takes is under less pressure, relaxed. 3rd house having benefics is more relaxed. Do have to work hard. If a malefic is in the 3rd house they promote that house in an aggressive way. LL Mo is aspecting LA, Cn. Important Arudha A10 and A5 are together forming nice yoga. 6th lord in 6th is Harsha yoga.

Dhimantha yoga - putting your abilities to overcome the obstacles. 5th and 9th lord are together gives a raja yoga. Su in GL is an adhi mitra dasamsa shows power, recognition of abilities. During Ma dasa, wherever he goes, he will get responsibilities to show his abilities. During this year, service is recommended because 6th lord of service is strong in its own house forming raja yoga. 10. For political leader, 5th house is very important as it's the house of recognition, abilities and following. 11.

From AL, it's the 8th house, which says loosing or gaining money suddenly in the financial status. Knowing whether it is a loss or gain is based on the malefic or benefic planet in that house respectively. Here look at the sign. Here it's a sign owned by the benefic planet so it a gain. 13. 2002 to 2004 is a Taurus dasa. From D2 LA, it's a quadrant, so he has to put efforts to manage the finance.

If a malefic (Sa) is there it means you have energy, drive and initiative to swim against the stream. Sa owns 6th and 7th. 6th lord in 3rd is good placement akin to vipareeta raja yoga. A11 shows tangible gains. Lord Ve is not well placed (12th), to give financial results. The hora chart kareyesha Su (from rasi's 2nd lord) having aspect on Libra, is a very good protection. 15. According to the 3 part rule, the 1st portion being Sirshodaya rasi gives the result of the rasi itself 1st. 2nd, the lord Ve is placed in Prishtodaya rasi. 16. So the lord gives it's result in last 1/3rd of the dasa. The aspects and occupants of the Li rasi give the middle 1/3. 17. 2004 to 2007 period, the sign gives result. He may have to work hard. 2007 to 2010 is a very good period. Su and Ma raja yoga results are given in this period. After 2010, he has to watch out. Not a good one. 18. To see in general, whether an investment is good for this person, look at the Arudha pada of the 12th house, UL. Investing is letting/giving away some thing go, which is 12th house/UL matters. UL is in 8th house in D2. It shows the investments are made in impulse w/o much of thoughts. Will his investments give him gains or loss? Since his UL is in 11th from AL, people perceive that, he gains from his investments. A5 being with UL, it shows the world, that he is capable of investing. A11 shows the tangible gains in this investment. For that there should be a link b/n UL and A11, some how. 19. According to 2004 TP chart, checking the hora lord Mo in D2 TP chart. It's in 12th from LA. It shows some tightness in the financial situation. From AL it's in the 8th. Krishna paksha Mo is a malefic.

So there will be a new beginning or a new start. It's in the 3rd house which is a good house for Me. From AL, Me is in the 11th house, which means others think he's making gains. So overall a good year. Ve and Ju form raja yoga. 22. In 2006, hora lord is Mo. In D2 TP, Mo forms kind of vipareeta raja yoga. There is a Parivartana b/n 3rd lord and 12th lord, which is an auspicious yoga. The planet who is supposed to give losses is made to work hard here. Not bad. From AL, Mo is in the 5th house of abilities. So this year is also a good year as far as finance is concerned. 23. So overall from all the above analysis, our conclusion is coming 11 months are very favorable. He may have to look for system/device verification kind of job in the coming year. 24. If the quadrant lord is in devaloka (in Vimsopaka balas), then that person will have a caliber of a Rishi and will do very good karma in that planet's period. Here in D1 chart, Sa is the quadrant lord placed in develoka. So these results are likely to be felt in Sa's period 25.

Lesson #44 Compiled by Saloni Fadia Topics Covered: 1. Questions and Answers Session. 2. Drig dasa – Brief Introduction Key Points: Q1: How do you know if a chart time is accurate or not? Will that change the ASC for the rasi charts and also the divisional charts? It is not always that a chart of a particular country or person will be true and accurate. For example no one knows for sure when USA signed for its independence. There are at least 10 to 15 USA charts with different times and dates.

{"chunk_id": 185, "book": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01", "text": "natal charts for doing a reading. Uncertainty of the time will change the ASC and also the navamsa and all the other divisional charts. The ASC changes every 4 minutes in the D-24 and every 6 minutes in the D-20 and every 2 minutes in the D-60. It is best to look at the various LA’s and see which one makes more sense. You should look at the rasi chart and judge from the moon also. Q2: How do you predict events and what planets do you look at and also what houses to see the effects? Every planet’s position can be taken as an ASC and looked at issues covering those planets. We look at the moon as the ASC to judge how the mind of the person is. To see what the level of energy or drive is, we look at mars as the LA. To look at the wisdom or intelligence we use Ju as the LA. For sense pleasures and happiness we look at Ve as the LA. The philosophy of Astakavarga is based on this principle. If you want to see the hard work and discipline the person will have then look at Sa as the LA. Look at the ownership, occupancy, avastha. For example if Ju is the 8th lord in the 8th house we first see what planet it is and then its agenda and how is it disposed. The ASC stands for the sum total of your being. So if you take Ju as ASC here the first thing you see is that Ju is well placed in its own house, then look at how the other planets are in relation to Ju in the 8th house as the LA. See if the planets are helping or hurting Ju and its agenda. Ju in the 8th is a good yoga in its own house. The agenda is the 8th house so all the positive aspects of the 8th house (sudden developments in life, beneficial changes) will come into play. The 8th lord in the 8th house is called Sarala yoga and since it is Ju its effect Lesson #44 201 will be gentler in pace and effect. If say Ma was the 8th lord in the 8th house it would be aggressive and not so gentle and peaceful. When we look at the 8th house we look for changes, uncertainty (for either", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 186, "book": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01", "text": "good or bad) and depending on what planet it is – it will give results accordingly. So if the 6th house lord is in the 6th house then it will never do harm. The 6th house stands for service, obstacles and so the 6th lord being in the 6th house will enable the person to overcome the obstacles. The agenda of the planet will be to overcome the obstacles. When the 6th lord is in the 6th house it is called Harsha yoga, it will give a worry-free and easy going situation especially if a benefic planet is the 6th lord in its own house. Malefic like Ma will give some problems but it will give the person opportunities to overcome the difficulties. If you want to judge the hard work the person will do, then see the 8th house from Sa. According to Brihat Parasara, the house rather than the karaka is most important. If you want to see the power of the person, see the 5th house from Su. If you want to see the courage of the person, see the 3rd house from Ma. For children see the 5th house from Ju. For mental peace see the 4th house from Moon, especially in the Navamsa chart since it is the chart of the inner self. Rasi chart is the chart of outer self. For mental happiness see the 4th house from Mo in the Navamsa chart. For analyzing luxurious, see the 4th house from Ve in all the charts. The 4th house from the Mo in D-24 or D-20 shows how peaceful the person is. The 5th from the Su in D-10 shows the power one will enjoy in the professional life. Q3: How do you look at Arudha LA’s and read them in context to the Rasi chart and other planets? The ASC stands for the physical body. The image your body has to the outer world is seen from the AL. So if the 8th house from ASC is strong but the 8th from Sa is weak it can create problems and bring changes and will be unlucky. The ability to struggle is not there. So the Arudha of the 8th house (A8) shows the tangible manifestation of the problem. Looking at the 9th house (A9) shows the fortune of the person. So if a person has a strong A9 and is say for example", "source": "lessons-on-vedic-astrology-01_page_unknown"}

Example Chart: Birth time 9:27pm; Mumbai; India Jan 14, 1964. Here the 9th lord Ma (which is the yogakaraka) is exalted in the 6th house of Capricorn but it is combust. Combustion is important but it is overrated. If say Ve was very close to Su and combust then it Lessons on Vedic Astrology 202 would be bad but when we are looking at Ma which is like a Army chief is close to the Su who is the king, and both are Kshatriya’s it is less important of a problem as compared to say if Ju was too close to the Su. Here since Ma is so close to the Su it will behave like Su. The A9 being in the 12th house (Cancer) it means giving up the country you were raised in to experience the fortunes in life. A9 has rasi drishti of Taurus, Aquarius and Scorpio, and thus Ve (in Aquarius) is thus aspecting A9. Ve is the karaka of the Upapada (UL) and lord of UL, is aspecting A9 thus shows that there will be fortune after marriage through spouse. Since Mo is the lord of the 12th house and it is with Ke and with Me which is the Arudha LL (AL) the world will see this person as a fortunate person. The Su and Ma being together in the 6th house of Capricorn is the real raja yoga. The Maya based raja yoga is seen from the AL (mercury) and since its lord is with the A9 lord (moon) although it is eclipsed by Ke since Ve is aspecting A9 it will bring fortune to the spouse. Q4: How do the gochara planets (transiting planets) affect Arudha LA? Gochara planets (transiting planets) also affect the Arudhas. For example, Sa in Ge for this person was a bad transit since Sa was with the AL. Ju transit in the 4th house from AL (Virgo) is good but once it comes into Li (in trine to AL) it is not considered good.

If the two planets are enemies it will give a bad yoga. Also say if there is parivartana yoga between 8th and 9th lord then it is a bad yoga. But a parivartana between 7th and 9th house lords yoga is good. So the house and the planet both are important. Between 3rd and 7th house since they are in the same trikona, it is a good yoga. The 3rd house stands for initiative and the 7th house stands for experience and strong drive, it is good. Q6: How to see if a person is a spiritual person or not? What are the signs or houses or planets which show a spiritual person? A strong Su shows someone who is atma jyana. A strong Ju shows someone who is a wise and knowledgeable person like Swami Aurobindo. A strong Sa shows one who is a sanyasi and who has no desire and is happy to work hard. A strong moon shows someone who is compassionate. Every planet can give spirituality. We should see D-20 (Vimsamsa chart) and there see the 4th and 9th house. Also see the 4th house from AL in the D-20 and see which planet it is? If it is Ju the person will be happy to follow the tradition, Lesson #44 203 if the planet is Moon/ Me it means the person has bhakti yoga and if there is Sa it means he is a yogi. To see what direction the atma is taking see the 4th from atmakaraka and the narayana dasa of D-20 to see the spiritual progress. To see the spirituality of the person see the rasi dasa (drig dasa) which shows the progress the person is making, and if that is aspected by Ke or containing Ke it is very auspicious. Q7: How effective is it to use gems for remedial measures? For remedial measures the best and Satwik approach is to pray to the various deities. Wearing gems as a remedial measure is a Rajasik approach. It is also not advisable to wear dusthana lord’s gems. Also it is advisable not to wear gem stones of planets of the 2nd and 7th house since these are maraka houses.

Example Chart 1: Male; Jan 10 1953, Manchester UK , 20:16(Local time) or 20:25(GMT). Discussed which of LMT or GMT is correct time. 4. Example Chart 2: Sachin Tendulkar - Apr 24 1973, 16:28 IST, 70E00 20N00, 5:30 East of GMT. Discussed a. Marriage prediction, b. Guessing wife's career and application of Graha arudhas c. Annual TP charts 1998, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2006 & 2009. Key Points: Example Chart 1: 1. This chart is presented with 10 minute uncertainty. Discussed below is GMT and Local Mean time. 2. Every place had its own time before the standard time came into vogue. In JHORA, If you use LMT instead automatically, it will make Time Zone 0 basically making it mutually exclusive. 3. Reason, Look at the Longitude, 2 W 13 minutes of GMT. Apply 4 minutes for every degree...13minutes can be approximated to 1/4 degree(15minutes). Therefore, LMT will be off from standard time by 2.25 degrees*4 = roughly 9minutes. 4. Basically, 20:16 LMT and 20:25 GMT are one and the same. You can verify this using Jhora with and without checking \"Use LMT instead\". There is a small error, however. 5. Its not that one is more accurate than the other. If your watch was set to LMT or GMT, you should enter the time accordingly in JHora.If you were to accurately find the LMT, it comes to 20:15:8 and this was approximated to 20:16. Both these times have the same ASC. 6. Usually people use clock time, based on a particular TZ, standard time. Radio time is found for the particular line that goes through. Radios/TVs stick to standard time. Old charts were calibrating it for the LMT, as far as they are concerned, they are at a fixed point. 7. Tricky only when you look at old charts. Somebody may have converted standard to LMT or vice versa, you need to ask that person. You may have to take both into account(cause you can Lesson #45 205 never be sure) and see which makes more sense.

They think that using LMT will give more accurate time, which is true ONLY if that TZ was used in measuring the time. You are well advised to start with a birth time which is +/- 5-10 minutes off. Example Chart 2: Sachin Tendulkar Chart Analysis \"Nimitta\" - Phone rings as Narasimha brings the chart up and was pondering about the birth time. Nimittas are auspicious events to help \"remove confusion\". Puzzle: Sachin got married in either of 1994, 1995 or 1996. Look at Annual TP charts and find the possible month when he got married. Marriage Prediction : 1994 Annual TP: 9. In Rasi HL - Me is in 8th house with 12th lord sun. Vivaha sahama is in 28 24\" Sg. 10. 7th Lord and UL lord, Ju is in the 2nd house and in a quadrant to HL - good 11. In D9 7L moon is in Lagna and Ra is in the 7th house. There is some chance Marriage Prediction : 1995 Annual TP: 12. In Rasi HL - Ve(Naisargika vivaha karaka) exalted in the 12th house. Lord of Kutumbhasthana(2nd) and 7th house. 13. Navamsa Ju is the 7th L in the 8th house in Neecha( retrograde) and because of Neecha bhanga raja yoga, behaves as if he is in Cancer.5th Lord Ve is associated with Lagna Lord Mercury. Both are in UL. 14. Vivaha Sahamas - 26 Ta 24, Owned by Venus, significator of marriage. See Ju(7th lord in navamsa), 9th Lord is aspecting vivaha sahama closely and aspecting it and in a trine to Venus. Chances are much better. 15. Sachin - natal lagna - Virgo. From Virgo, annual TP lagna is the 8th house - that is the area of life which will be very strong during that year - truth, blessings or curses relating to the 8th house(in rasi) will be manifested in the current year. 16. House alone - This is not a single factor which will shadow everything else. Also look at who is in the 8th house, 8th Lord - all these play a role too.8th house has Ve, exalted Sun. Results related to Venus and Sun can be experienced. Exalted Mars will be activated. Overall, chances are pretty strong that he will get married this year. Lessons on Vedic Astrology 206 17.

It is highly unlikely that they will exchange results with Jupiter. 19. Venus gets maximum vote. Jupiter follows next followed by Me and Ra. Concluding, 1995 is a strong candidate for giving marriage. Marriage Prediction : 1996 Annual TP: 20. In Rasi HL is sun -> exalted 3rd lord in the 11th house with the 11th lord. Forgetting marriage for a second, we can say with confidence that this is a year of great gains. Note, the 3rd lord, seed of kama trikona is strong, hence great year for achievement.5th Lord Venus is in lagna and 7th lord Ju is in 7th house. 21. In Navamsa Parivarthana between Moon(7th) and Mars(10th) lords. Ra is weakening this exchange. Vivaha sahama is in 25 Vi 2\". Ra (21 Vi 47\") is quite close and afflicting it. Sa is the 8th and 9th L aspecting virgo.1996 indicates strong possibilities and afflictions too - reasonable candidate.1995 is the pick. Let us time the marriage now: 22. Ve dasa is the clear favorite (Sep-Nov 95). turns out Sachin did not marry during this period. Me dasa seems less likely, Asc lord in D9 joining Ve but 3rd and 6th lord in rasi.Ju is the 9th L in rasi and 7th lord in navamsa aspecting vivaha sahama. Moreover, Jupiter has the ear of the king, in rasi he is in a trine to the HL Venus. 23. Strong possibility of Marriage in Ju-Ve (May 23- jun6) - true, Marriage occurred on May 25th.Note, in the natal chart, lagna lord is in the 7th house in both rasi and navamsa - standard rule in classics say such a person is \"henpecked\". Graha Arudhas: 24. Houses are inanimate beings, no potency in them - denote the limbs of kalapurusha. House lords are the intelligence that drive the matters of various houses, they are the avataras of Maha Vishnu (Ke - Meena(fish) avatara, Ra - Varaha(pig) avatara)...Narayana (paramapurusha) is the energy that makes the world move.

Therefore, house lords are the satya and they too have arudhas called \"graha arudhas\". 26. Graha arudhas are calculated like this - from the house lord of interest, count how many houses to the house. Calculate so many houses from the house and you arrive at \"graha arudha\". 27. Lets take Sachin Tendulkar's chart. In navamsa, take the 7th Lord Sun(in Cancer). 7th house is Leo. Number of houses from House Lord, Sun to Leo is 1. Count 1 house from 7th house, Leo and you end up at Virgo which is the graha arudha of the 7th house(wife). Now, you can make conclusions about wife and her career using Virgo as lagna - this shows the image, manifestation of the wife as an intelligent, thinking persons. 28. JHORA HOW-TO: Pick any chart of interest. Right Click- >Choose a View (this option is the 2nd from the bottom)- >Standard View with Graha arudhas. 29. Consider 4th house - shows the learning process.4th Lord shows the supreme intelligence applied to learning - it is animate and shows a person like a guru, friend, student or even an enemy. An enemy makes fun of me and makes me think and I learn in the process. 30. Consider these statements, \"Wife is an excellent engineer\" \"father became the president of India\" \"brother became doctor and got the best doctor award\" - all these show the graha arudhas of wife, father and brother in the corresponding divisional charts respectively. 31. If you want to talk about father in dwadasamsa(d12), 9th house, 9th Lord, Arudha of the 9th house and Graha arudha are important. Same can be said about self, ASC, LL, AL and Graha Arudha of lagna (L1) need to be considered. 32. Lagna is the circumstance of your existence. Lagna Lord(satya) is the intelligence actively driving your existence, decision making, thinking, feeling. When someone says \"very intelligent knowledgeable person\", that is the arudha of the Lagna lord (i.e. graha arudha) rising. This is maya relating to the Narayana within you. 33.

Applying the same to profession,someone can be an engineer, doctor, lawyer- this shows the maya surrounding their existence( inanimate, kalapurusha).

In Tendulkar's chart, A7 in Navamsa is Ge - this shows the arudha of the 7th house...maya surrounding Tendulkar's wife, it Lessons on Vedic Astrology 208 shows the circumstances of her creation. A7 is influenced by Ke, Ra, Ma, Me. 10th house from A7 has Ke and 10th from 7th has Ju indicating something satwic/spiritual type career. Also note, Ma/Ke are the 6th lords from Virgo and in 4/10 houses respectively, 2nd lord Moon in 6th house. Mo+Ke+Ma -> one of the possible results given by classics is a doctor and she is a psychotherapist. Is it an intelligent career - Ketu in 10th can make one a headless whacko. Is \"whacko\" maya or satya. Take the Graha arudha to judge that. Look at 10th from L7, it has Mercury in the 4th house aspecting the 10th house - shows a very analytical, lunar, piscean circumstances surrounding her job. Putting the two together, we can see so much about the person's career. 36. There are 5 things which you need to consider a. A5 - arudha of the 5th house - tangible manifestation of abilities, an inanimate object like a trophy or certificate or memento. b. 5th from AL - Perceived abilities of my tangible inanimate existence. c. 5th from Lagna lord - ability paramapurusha has endowed you with d. 5th from Graha arudha of the 5th house(L5) - perceived abilities in the minds of people - of the tangible manifestation of paramapurusha within me. e. 5th from Lagna - real ability. 37. Make sure you understand the above definitions or stick to ASC, houses from it and arudha lagna and house from it. Contemplate and do tapasya to get clarity. Kalapurusha(maya) is evident, tangible and easier to understand. Narayana or parama purusha is subtle. Beejakshara and Beeja mantras to get clarity: Pray to Dakshina Murthy. 38.

Ida nadis (left brain) cross with Pingala nadis(right brain) in the neck region. 40. People with Strong Left Brain are mathematical - denotes Pingala nadi. People with Strong right brain are intuitive - denotes Ida nadi. Use beejakashara depending on which nadi you want to activate. 41. Any day is good, preferably Thursday to chant these. If the mind is pure, this can be chanted anytime, any day and anywhere. But, powerful beeja mantras need to be taught by a guru and some opine that a good posture is necessary. 42. Remember, different vowels stand for different things. a. A - stands for creation b. E - stands for sustenance c. U or O as in \"hroom\" - destructive. Removal of poisons from the subtle body. d.
