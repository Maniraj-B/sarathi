There have been Ayurvedic physicians reputed for their genius and deep knowledge of the science in Kerala. The contribution of Ashta Vaidya families, Gurukulas and the traditional toxicologists for the enrichment of Ayurvedic studies is invaluable. But as the wheel of time turns, some lose ‘their glory and get subordinated to others. This was the plight .of Ayurveda some eighty years ago. It was a time when the allopathic system suitable to modern ways of life.in:. form and content and fully supported by the‘Government was gaining popularity. Scarcity of physicians truly knowledgeable in Ayurveda, lack of facilities for studying Ayurveda properly, the -inconvenience felt naturally by patients-in preparing at home the medicines prescribed by Ayurvedic physicians, even as ready- made allopathy medicines were becoming common, lack of encouragement from the Government - many such factors as these combining to push it on to the verge of collapse - this was the picture of Ayurveda at the beginning of the twentieth century. ‘ # ot \"P.S.

We have deleted some inconsequential medicines and added a few new ones. It deserves special mention that an article by the author, entitled \"The principles of Ayurveda\" published in \"Dhanwan. thari\" (Book 19 vol. 11 and 12) dated June 15 and July 16, 1922 is appended to this edition. It is hoped that the way the author endeavoured to synthesise traditional and modern principles will become clear from this article, and that the inquisitive wil] welcome this. In what circumstances and to solve what all problems was the Arya Vaidya Sala established have been clarified in the author's preface to the first edition. Thanks to his drive and dedication, those problems were solved then. Today we have new problems facing Ayurveda. The countrywide inflation is one such. It has also become difficult to get herbs and drugs essential in the manufacture of medicines. ‘Though preliminary steps are already on for the large scale cultivation of herbs in a scientific manner, it is high time that the Government and private agencies urgently make efforts in this direction. It is a happy augury that many new projects are being formulated by the Government for the development of Ayur- veda. But it cannot be forgotten that there are many regulations that handicap the manufacture and distribution of medicines. Due to the general restrictions on Narcotics, it has become almost impossible to get drugs like hemp (Ganja) and opium, necessary for the manufacture of some Ayurvedic medicines at proper times and in adequate quantities and so we have been forced to discontinue the manufacture of some medicines. It has already been stated that due to the unprincipled clearance of forests, the growth of herbs is diminishing. It is to be feared that if this trend continues, production of medicines will be handicapped, however much science may progress. We therefore entreat the Government to pay due attention to this matter. The public and their representatives must realise this, and press the Government to adopt appropriate remedial measures. Since the use of advanced machinery and modern technol- ogy will help speed up production and improve the quality of medicines and reduce production cost, we have developed vari- ous equipments ever since 1950.

Warrier, 1-5-1994 Managing Trustee . ‘and --Chief Physician PREFACE TO THE FIRST MALAYALAM EDITION It does not seem necessary to explain anything to any- body about the grandeur of Ayurveda which we proudly consider for long as an especial wealth of India. Still, as Vagbhata says, “anfa grerecae wh caterer’. It is widely recognised that over sometime in the past this indigenous system of medicine has come to suffer great disrepute and degradation due to the indifference, incompetence and helplessness of most of the Ayurvedic physicians to comprehend its merits and demerits and to practise it in the proper manner. Nothing seems to be more shameful than that this wealth acquired by our ancestors through long and arduous work, so useful to all of us, young and old, is not only in the least not added to by us, but is allowed to decay day by day through our indolence and by remaining callously unmoved and even indul- gent when others, either misguided or envious, ridicule it with imaginary allegations. To say anything more on the low standard of our phy- sicians of the day may irk many. Better refrain from further polemics. Still, I dare not leave it here without saying a few words on the present state of indigenous medicines. It is lay workers who are engaged in the collection, storage, preservation, buying, selling and processing of raw drugs; they do not add these in the formulations appropriately at the required time and even though available in plenty, they often use one drug for the other due to wrong identification. Besides, with the passage of time and due to lack of experience, a great number of herbs and drugs have become unobtainable after due identification. Vv Thus since the physicians ertrust the work to others with- out shouldering responsibility themselves, people take the ef- fects of medicines declared in the medical", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

When prescribing \"Draksadi Yoga\", the physician only lists “Parusaka\" by its vernacular equivalent \"Cittinthal\" in his prescription, but when asked \"What is Cittinthal?\" or \"Where is it obtainable\", he merely answers, \"That is to be referred to the herb-gatherers\"; in fact, one earnestly wishes to meet a physician who can know- ledgeably explain herbs. How can a soldier who little knows the weapon he wields be expected to win a battle? It is no wonder that in our age of advancing civilization, people become dissat- isfied and faithless about such physicians. All this is said only to emphasise the need for the phy- sicians to have close acquaintance with medicines; no one need take this as advocating that every physician must prepare and keep his medicines independently. Not that this is not excellent; only it is impractical. It is well-known that although house-hold _ Tequirements like articles of food, dress and furniture are all essential for everybody, it is not the way of the world to make all these things oneself; this is just not possible. It is thus our view that the need of the hour is not to strain in isolation, but to resort to division of labour and work in co- operation. We are confident that if some physicians form a company to closely examine and select drugs and herbs and manufacture medicines with due care and thought, without in the least deviating from scientific principles and experience, and other practitioners buy them and utilise them in affording the best treatment, both parties will derive due profits, patients will have convenience and people will have satisfaction and faith in the system. Practitioners of English medicine have their advantage in such an arrangement. They have a great number of medical shops in all towns ready with all medicines and equipments - needed for treatment. Why can we also not have such arrange- \"ments? It is senseless to raise objections by pointing to the ways vi of our ancestors. Actors are not always born of actresses. It is gad that the time for the timely reformation of Ayurveda is long past, but it can be boldly asserted that if we work in co-operation as indicated, success is bound to follow.

Orders for medicines began to flow in from far and near. This.forced him to expand his institution and to augment production. It was Arya Vaidya Sala that first pub- lished a catalogue of some Ayurvedic. medicines in 1903 with general details like dosage, usage and price, in South India. Seeing these experiments succeed, many have followed this model. te Progress was speedy. When demand for medicines in- creased a Branch was opened at Kozhikode in October 1916 and at Palakkad in April 1932. AYURVEDA COLLEGE P.S. Varier, who was farsighted, foresaw the need for sending out those who have studied the science deeply to dif- ferent parts of the country for the effective propagation of Ayurveda. Facilities to study properly and gain practical experience in the science were lacking at that time. To solve this problem he established an Ayurveda College in January 1917 to ix run a four-year course in a building, adjacent to the Kozhikode Branch of his Vaidyasala. The college functioned under the auspices of the Arya Vaidya Samajam, a registered body, of which P.S. Varier was the guide and secretary. However, Arya Vaidya Sala was the source of its finances. “Arya Vaidya\" the diploma approved by the Madras Government was bestowed on those who passed the course. Later, when a Charitable Hospital named Ayurveda Chikitsa Sala was set up at Kottakkal in 1924, under Arya Vaidya Sala, the college was shifted to the Hospital Annexe in view of the better facilities available for students for Practical training. Those who passed out of the college are now rendering medical service independently all over the country. MEDICAL LITERATURE: ARTS Soon after the first catalogue of medicines was published in 1903, P. S. Varier brought out his Malayalam work \"Chikitsa Samgraham\". This mentions not only the acknowledged effects, dosage and methods of use of all medicines prepared in the Arya Vaidya Sala, but also the system of weights and measures, common remedies for various diseases with appropriate Ayur- vedic regimen, the Panchakarma courses and Kerala specialities like Dhara and Pizhichil, in so simple a language that the common man can easily understand it.

This work aims at explaining in simple terms “ Sareeram\" of Ayurveda and Anatomy and Physiology of the western system and contains over 3000 verses and 200 illustrations. This work earned a special certificate at the hands of Pandit Madan Mohan Malavya, then President of the All India Ayurvedic Congress, at its sixteenth session. This is prescribed as the main text for the new syllabus approved by the Kerala Government. He had later elaborated this eight volumes with the title \"Brihat Sareeram\" and had brought out the first volume. The second volume was x posthumously published in 1969. A magazine entitled \"Dhanwanthari\", which ran for about 25 years under his editorship, helped in the progress and popularisation of Ayur- veda. An enthusiast in all forms of art and a dramatist, he has authored many dramas in Malayalam. The crowning examples of his interest in the promotion of art are the P.S.V. Dramatic Troupe which was promoted by Arya Vaidya Sala and the P.S.V. Natya Sangham which is still in existence. AYURVEDA CHIKITSA SALA P.S. Varier set up the Ayurveda Chikitsa Sala, a Chari- table Hospital in 1924 close to the Arya Vaidya Sala. There are facilities for treatment of poor patients, with free food and medicines. He appointed an Ayurvedic and an Allopathic doctor here to examine and treat patients. In a place like Kottakkal, where private agencies, local bodies or the Government did not run even a rural dispensary, this Charitable Hospital was a blessing to the people residing within a radius of 15 km. around. RECOGNITION In consideration of the services rendered for the develop- ment of Ayurveda through the Arya Vaidya Sala, Ayurveda College and Publication of books and magazine, P.S. Varier was nominated by the Madras Government to the Central Board of Indian Medicines when it was constituted in 1932. Later he continued on the Board as an elected member until his death. He was also a member of the Board of Examination of the Government School of Indian Medicine. In recognition of the multifarious services rendered by him for the development of the Ayurvedic system and thereby to humanity, the Government of India honoured him with the award of \"Vaidyaratnam\" in 1933. xi A NEW CHAPTER January 30, 1944: That was a black day for us and for every one connected with our institution,", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

Varier who was seen in good health and spirits even the previous night came to the end of his earthly life that morning at 5.30 in the 75th year of his life. Before his death, however, he had raised to a very high status all the movements he had started - Arya Vaidya Sala and the institutions under it. AFTER THE VAIDYARATNAM Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier was a unique personality with a rare combination of extra-ordinary organisational and mana- gerial talents, effervescent enthusiasm and spirit of service. On his death many were apprehensive of the future of Arya Vaidya Sala and the allied institutions. But the years after his death have proved that all such apprehensions were out of place. Arya Vaidya Sala and the allied institutions continued to scale new heights, doubtless due to one factor; the foresight of Vaidyaratnam. A GRAND WILL & TESTAMENT Vaidyaratnam had clear ideas about how his institutions were to be run after his time. He laid a firm foundation for this through his grand testament. The testament lays down that Arya Vaidya Sala and allied institutions shall be administered by a Turst and the income utilised for specific purposes. He formed the Trust with seven efficient and loyal members selected from his relatives and Arya Vaidya Sala employees. He had appointed his nephew, the late P.M. Varier as the first Managing Trustee and the Chief Physician. Vaidyaratnam had stipulated that the income of Arya Vaidya Sala be utilised for the following purposes: a) To improve Ayurveda through research and other means so as to make it more useful for the people. b) To afford free treatment to poor patients. c) Torun the Ayurveda College. d) To improve Arya Vaidya Sala. e) To maintain the P.S.V. Drama troupe (now the Natya sangham) f) To conduct the annual and other festivals in the Sri Viswambhara temple. He had even fixed the limits for the expenditure or the percentage of income to be spent for each purpose. There is also provision for granting old age benefits of various types to the employees of the institution.

Since the installation of the Steam plant in January, 1967, considerable progress has been achieved in production. During this period, Arya Vaidya Sala started many new Branches, Agencies and Sales Depots. Branches were opened at Tirur and Erode in 1947. A new depot at Palakkad and a Branch xiii at Ernakulam were opened in 1957. The Thiruvanantapuram branch followed in 1959, Aluva depot in 1962, a Depot at Kot- takkal bazar in 1963, and the Madras branch in 1968. The opening of a Sales depot at Kozhikode in 1972, a new branch at Kannur in 1975, another at Coimbatore in 1976 and one at New Delhi in 1981 need special mention. The number of approved agencies and depots at present exceeds 500. Today there are agencies in all parts of India and at Singapore and Malaysia. The sale of medicines progressed systematically dur- ing this period. ° NURSING HOME Vaidyaratnam had provided in his Will for medical advice and treatment on the basis of the capacity of the patients. A large number of patients came and were treated during his days. Amongst them are celebrated personalities like Jayaprakash Narayan. Some apartments in the Arya Vaidya Sala used to be arranged for them, or a suitable house in the vicinity was hired. In course of time, patients arrived in large numbers. Late P.M. Varier decided to provide convenient and modern lodgings for them, and set himself to work for it. The Golden Jubilee Nursing Home was inaugurated on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the Arya Vaidya Sala when the 29th Annual Session of All India Ayurvedic Congress was held here in 1954. ‘This Nursing Home with single rooms, double rooms and family blocks furnished with all amenities is a blessing to the sick. Again in 1963, a new building was opened for in-patients. But the need for additional buildings continued. The Golden Jubilee Nursing Home hardly met the needs of the increasing number of patients.

AYURVEDA COLLEGE It is gratifying that many holders of the Diploma \"Aryavaidyan\" from the Arya Vaidya Patha Sala founded by Vaidyaratnam in 1917 are at present serving the sick in all parts of India. The Ayurveda College syllabus was modernised and unified after the Kerala State was formed and a new D.A.M. course was introduced here in 1959. The Golden Jubilee of the Ayurveda College was cele- brated in 1968. The new building for the college inauguratéd on the oceasion combines all facilities necessary for a modern college. The efforts to start a degree course resulted in introducing the B.A.M.., course in 1972. This college is now affiliated to the Calicut University. This was working under a registered body named Arya Vaidya Samajam, but now it functions under the ' Kerala Ayurvedic Studies and Research Society, a registered society constituted with representatives of the Central and State Governments and the Arya Vaidya Sala for the expansion of the college and for developing higher studies and research in Ayur- veda. Vaidyaratnam has set apart-upto ten percent of the net income of Arya Vaidya Sala for college purposes. This amount which.-was ‘being spent for the Arya Vaidya Samajam is now handed over to the society. Postgraduate courses in mental diseases and toxicology are being planned under this new society. : % CHARITABLE HOSPITAL “The Charitable Hospital was started in 1924 for giving free treatment to the poor. Clinical arrangements for treating in- patients with free medicine and food are available here. On an xv | average, about 900 out-patients are attended to daily and given free medicines. In 1960, a maternity ward attached to the Chari- table Hospital was opened. A Panchakarma ward was also inaugurated in 1965. Here, costly treatments like Navarakkizhi, Pizhichil, Dhara etc., are given free to poor patients. Modern diagnostic facilities like clinical laboratory, X-ray plant etc., have also been made available here. oe CLINICAL RESEARCH WARD : Ayurvedic Research has been specially mentioned in Vaidyaratnam PS.

NATYASANGHAM The Paramasiva Vilasam Drama Troupe started by Vaidyaratnam in 1909, which had for 30 years earned reputation as one of the foremost drama troupes of Kerala, had during his xvi life time itself (1939) been converted into P.S.V. Natyasangham (Kathakali troupe). This troupe which is even.today run on well organised lines, is capable of staging all the existing Attakathas of the day most beautifully. It has staged performances, in all parts of India and earned public acclaim. In 1959, it conducted a foreign tour under the leadership of Smt. Kamala Ghia and staged Kathakali performances at various places. The P.S.V. Natyasangham consists of artistes famous in the fields of Vesha, music and accompaniments. The Central Government had deputed P.S.V. Natyasangham to present the story of Rama- yana at the International Ramayana Festival in Indonesia in 1971. The Sangham can proudly recollect that rare occasion, which earned the acclaim of all sections. TOWARDS BETTER PROGRESS The above is a clear picture-of Arya Vaidya Sala and the institutions under it, steadily progressing along the path cleared by Vaidyaratnam. This does not, however, mean that there were no difficulties in the past. «Especially the death of the then Managing Trustee, P.M. Varier, in a plane accident in 1953 was a heavy blow to the Arya Vaidya Sala in its progress. After the untimely death of Sri. P.M.

The secrets of the success of Arya Vaidya Sala is that the Trustees of Arya Vaidya Sala, its man- agement and employees are functioning as a single family, keep- ing in view that ultimate aim of the welfare of humanity. The basic rules of Vaidyaratnam were love and confidence. It can no doubt be said that even now those are the principles governing the functioning of the Arya Vaidya Sala. It is specially worth recollecting that the late Sri. V.V.Giri, as the Vice-president of India (1968) and later as the President of India (1970) stayed in Arya Vaidya Sala's Kailasamandiram for treatment for one month on each occasion and left after being relieved of his ailments. May the standing monuments of Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier's glory - Arya Vaidya Sala, Ayurveda College, Charitable Hospital and Natyasangham - make steady progress and live for ever. PRINCIPLES OF AYURVEDA* Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier It is the common belief that Ayurveda is eternal. This does not refer to the work of any particular author. Ayurveda is the collection of the principles of life that took birth with the world itself and is not liable to change at any time or in any part of the world. It is also believed that these principles were discovered by Brahma, the Creator himself and compiled into a large volume. This original work came to be called ‘Ayurveda’. The ancient sages who later realized that it is impossible for anyone to learn this big compilation in a lifespan, divided it into eight parts; and some of them came to pay special attention to particular parts. In course of time students found it hard to learn even these parts as it took much time. As knowledge of all these parts was essential to become a good physician or surgeon, later authors", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

Thus the original work came to be kept aside and got perished as time passed, while the abridged books took its place. The aim of the abridgers was to compress the whole matter into fewer words. As long as there were great and selfless sages to explain the proper meanings, this method brought no harm to the science or to the people. When such sages disappeared from the world and selfish people abounded in the country, the result became adverse. Later due to foreign invasions and consequent chaos, many reputed works on Indian science, including Ayurveda happened to perish. In due course, peace was restored and people went back to their own evocation. But, what was to be done? There were neither reliable texts to learn from, nor learned 4 Originally published in Malayalam in “Dhanvanthari” magazine of June 15 and July 16, 1922 (Book No. 19, Vol.11 & 12) XIX physicians to teach. In this critical situation almost all living physicians - some of them might even have been the direct disciples of the sages —prepared some works from memory and from such portions of the works which survived the chaos. Some errors naturally crept into these works as we see today; and the writers might have also made some mistakes. However, it is clear that words and even sentences of the basic texts have been misunderstood and used wrongly in the works we inherited. Consequently, obtaining practical knowledge from such works, particularly in anatomy and physiology, has been rendered difficult indeed. Most of these mistakes can be found out and rectified easily. And when so rectified, the original principles can be easily grasped and reaffirmed. But eminent scholars in eastern and western medical sciences must set themselves to this job with enthusiasm and understanding, as unadulterated portions are still available to us in works like Caraka, Susruta, Vrddha Vagbhata and Vagbhata. I believe this will facilitate further research. Let us now present some important principles of Ayurveda: Tridhatus Human body is made up of the five principles (Panca- mahabuthas) viz. Akasa (air), Vayu (vital force), Tejas (some minerals, acids, alkalies etc), Jala (water) and Prthivi (organic substances and earthly matter not included in others). Any part of the body, howsoever minute, is an inseparable combinations of these principles. In Ayurveda, combinations of these prin- ciples are classified into", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 13, "book": "chikitsa_samgraham", "text": "three, viz. Vayu or Vata, Mayu or Pitta and Valasa or Kapha. Of these the first is a combination of Akasa and Vayu, the second is Tejas, and the third is a combination of Prthvi and Jala. These three mega-divisions of the body particles are called the Tridhatus (fara wt aed wre -ae afer ) These not only build and sustain all parts of the body but also fulfill all biological function when alive. These cannot be de- tected in their original form in any parts of the body. We must identify these with those parts of the body, where they predomi- nate. Accordingly, Valasa is a combination of the materials used for structuring and sustaining the body, Mayu is a combination of the materials that digest the food and transform it into body- XX constituents, and Vayu is that body-constituent that generates power and motivity. Besides, Vayu includes that body-constitu- ent that carries oxygen to the part of the body for activating their bio-functions. The real nature of Vayu, Mayu and Valasa can be understood properly from the following; Prenat a Aare: wa eaomenss:, ad faratars trate, sraMsqahrermag vaerefta: \"i (acrdfea, gi -a. 22) \"Vayustantrayantradharah pranodanasamanavyana- panatma, pravartakascestanamuccavacanam niyanta, praneta ca manasah, sarvendriyanamudyojakah, sarvendriyarthana- mabhivodha, sarvasariradhatuvyuhakarah, sandhanakarah Sarirasya, pravartako vacah, prakrtih sparsasabdayoh, srotras- parsanayormulam, harsotsahayoryonih samiranoSgneh, dosasamsosanah, ksepta bahirmalanam, sthulanusrotasam bhetta, karta garbhakrtinam, ayusoSnuvrttipratyayabhuto bhavatyak- upitah” ‘ (Caraka Samhita, Su.

If the three impurities are provoked they have to be expelled (purified), and if they are on slight increase they have to be controlled (pacified). From this, the term Vata is to be taken as excessively vitiated gases, Pitta means the fluids of gall bladder and the wastes accumulated in the veins, and Slesma, the phlegm or mucus seen in the mouth and throat and other substances like albumin in the urine. So it is to be understood that Vata, Pitta and Kapha have three forms each viz., a dhathu, a mala and a dosa very different from each other in form and action. It is my opinion that the reason for the total misunder- standing of Ayurveda by western and eastern doctors is that they fail to comprehend these principles, and take one thing for the other. For a proper understanding of these principles, the fol- lowing quotation from “Brhat sariram\" may be useful: wearaa: | cee ATareaaqaata | ane rareaqaertad wires aafaacattarerearat i 10 \"Vayu's actions are slipping, cutting pain, piercing pain, numbness, sinking, constant pain, splitting pain, tearing pain, obstruction, twisting pain, contraction, rolling, horripilation, thirst, tremour, hoarseness, hollowness, ema- ciation, throbbing, wrapping, stiffness, astringency, and dark and roseate Pitta’s actions are burning, redness, heat, maturation, sweating, drench- ing, oozing, decaying, sinking, swooning, intoxication, acrid and sour tastes, and colours other than pale and roseate. : Kapha's actions are unction, hardness, itching, cold, heaviness, bond, smearing, immobility, swelling, lack of digestion, sleepiness, white-colour, sweet and salty tastes, and slowness of action. ; One must reckon properly and carefully by observation and other methods all the above mentioned symptoms of dosas covering the total disease.\") Treat waa arama sagem fe PTET TART. sera sarees et waqat \"| wakemranrareaa sty aeraa wmtaqqaedtaa qfaeranaaaiam waa aearerearateadtdyerecn Rests way 1 we aE a Tara WesMTeAMra a am, aaeaaEaata fara\" (qafaarrs ear) (\"Pancamahabhutapratinidhayopi vatapittakaphah dehadhar- anaddhatusamjnaya, rasadidusanaddosasamjnaya, srotasammalinikarananmalasamjnaya cabhihitah pracinacar- yaih.

In their Dhatu state, Vata, Pittaand Kapha are duly balanced and promote health and prophylaxis. In their dosa state they are unbalanced and make the body susceptible to diseases. In the Mala state they are so provoked that cure can be effected only by purification, or a cure is impossible and death results. The fact is that the three names indicate the three different Stages of the same Vata Pitta and Kapha.” 2 Xxxii Accordingly, the terms of Vata, Pitta and Kapha of Ayurveda used in the Sarira stanam (physiology and anatomy) are mostly with reference to their Dhatu state, the same terms used in Nidana (aetiology) refer to their dosa state, and in Cikitsa sthanam (treatment) they refer to their impure state. But in the books available at present these words are often seen used in confusion, taking one for the other in each context. Vaidyaratnam P.S.

If not stored by groups, they are hard to locate when needed, and to know what is available and what is not. The following guidelines, if followed, prevent such confusions. If the medicines are arranged properly, there will also be attraction. 1. Storehouse should face the road, but not far from it, on high ground. It should be spacious, with high ceiling and well ventilated. It should have shelves and cupboards for all medicines. Cupboards should have individual locking arrangements. Medicines should be kept off the floor. . Medicines should be kept in clean containers preferably of glass, all containers properly labelled, closed, sealed and wrapped. 7. Leave two-finger space between containers for easy han- dling. 8. It will be inconvenient to keep them in more than two rows on a shelf. 9. Labels should be towards the front, with bigger containers at the rear and smaller ones in front, so that all labels are . visible. 10. It will no doubt be a precaution to have labels on the con- tainers and wrappers. AV ew LP 16. 17. 21. 22. 23.

Burn a stove or candle in the storehouse during rainy and cold seasons for warmth. The second floor is preferred for storage during these seasons. Drizzle, dew, cold and moisture are harmful to medicines; so is direct sunlight in many cases. * Different groups of medicines must be stored in separate rooms or shelves. Arishtas must be held in specially strong bottles away from _ other items due to the risk of the bottles bursting. 18. Oils are best kept in china porcelain jars properly closed and taken into bottles only when necessary. ~ Pills must be exposed to the sun once every week in their containers. Those dried in shade must be covered with a thin cloth during such exposure. Ghritas are also to be stored like oils, but in wide-mouthed jars. - Powders should be packed in bottles when hot and the bottles exposed to sun weekly. Tailas should be kept in glass-stoppered bottles. Those with strong scent or potency should be sealed with wax or lac. Additives are to be kept in a secure place in glass containers, properly sealed with wax. Guidelines for the Storage of Medicines 3 24. Metal containers demand some caution. Glass and China containers are acceptable in all cases. , 25. Storehouse should always be under lock and key. 26. Special attention is to be paid to keep the store-house and surroundings scrupulously clean. GUIDELINES FOR HANDLING AND SERVING MEDICINES 1. Persons handling medicines must be thoroughly truthful, clean, knowledgeable and devoted. 2. Hands should be cleaned before handling medicines, be it ever so clean before. 3. Never touch a medicine with bare hand. 4. Measuring glass must be cleaned and weighing balance dusted always and the pans adjusted. 5. Even though medicines may have to be mixed, measuring glass must be cleaned each time, and the pans of the balance dusted and adjusted. It is never proper to be satisfied with the previous cleaning and leave the rest to the end. 6. Measuring glass and balance used must be appropriate to the quantities to be measured, bigger ones for larger quan- tities and small ones for small quantities; never the re- verse. 7.

Never take out from the bulk container more than what is actually required. If this is inadequate more can be taken out again. Putting back the surplus will spoil the contents. Extra care is necessary when measuring and mixing items for internal use. In the case of any error, discard the item taken out and take fresh quantities. Never let the error go as negligible. Never be approximate in measuring medicines, however minor. Use appropriate containers and never let any item go until | they are properly closed, sealed and labelled. In the case of medicines for internal use, dosage, timings, mixings if any, must all be indicated on the container label. Medicines for external use must have labels showing de- tails of any poisonous contents and the harm that may ensue if consumed. If this is not possible details must be written out and handed over to the patient or his repre- sentative. Bottles for oils for use on the head must be cleaned and dried two or three days in advance. If this is not done, wipe them clean with a fresh dry cloth. Don’t wash them. After all operations, all connected equipments are to be cleaned and restored to their proper places. 21. 24.

On the onset of any uneasiness, physical or mental, one should try to understand closely what his troubles are. One should examine if he has made any improper devia- tion from his routine and intimate a friend or relative about the nature of his disturbance. Once any symptom appears, don't delay seeking medical help. Choose a physician who is knowledgeable, experienced and sympathetic and has the \"golden touch\". . Keep quacks at bay (though not sufficiently qualified, there may be some who are not overbearing but possess the \"golden touch.\" They need not be included in the category of quacks). In major cases, consult more than one physician. Only take care that they are not competitors. . Don't mistrust your physician and his medicine. It is necessary that even when you are well you must fix up the physicians to be approached, if you fell ill. Avoid physicians and medicines in whom you lack faith. Give due honour to your physician and present to him full details of your troubles and any violations you might have made from routines. Don't hold anything back from the physician.

If there is no good physician nearby, go wherever there is one or better still, try to fetch one. Until the condition of the patient comes under control, the physician should be around nursing and administration of medicines and food must be under his special super- vision. The physician's instructions must be carefully listened to and implicitly followed. Any difficulty in following his directions must be dis- cussed with the physician then and there and suitable modifications made. No change is to be made on one's own. In case of any error the physician must be informed immediately. If the physician cannot administer the medicines himself, it is better that the patient helps himself after ascertaining clearly the mode and the dose and timing from the physician.

Even if some may, they won't grow properly. Similar is the case with treat- ment. Untimely treatment hardly brings results. If a case is not emergent, await the proper season. Ancestors chose three months as suitable for Kerala climate; Tulam (mid-Oct. to mid- Nov.) Kumbham (mid-Feb. to mid - March) and Karkitakam (mid-July to mid-August), when cold, heat and rain are moderate. This is based on the view that rains in Monsoon, heat in Summer, and cold in the cold seasons will be of normal intensity. If there are unusual variations, seasons for treatments should be adjusted suitably. The fortnights immediately before and after these three months are considered as acceptable as a second choice.", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 92, "book": "chikitsa_samgraham", "text": "These periods are suitable for all treatments like Dhara, Pizhichil, Navarakkizhi, Snehapana, Vasti and Raktamoksha (blood-let- ting) also for taking Kashayas, Bhasmas and Rasayanas. There is a view that Karkitakam is good for all cures (restoring Thridosha balance), Tulam ‘for excess Pitta and Kumbham for reducing Kapha. Serious and emergent cases need not wait for the season, but due caution is needed to protect the patient from unusual cold, heat, rain and mist. Courses that do not involve severe regimen need not wait for the season. Minor ailments depend much less on seasons. Changes in timings of doses can vary the results widely. A dose on empty stomach early in the morning is generally more effective. The rule is that when the patient is strong and the disease serious, medicine is to be taken on an empty stomach in the morning. There are two methods in vogue; to avoid a meal and take the medicine alone, or take a smaller dose and eat after digesting it fully or before digestion starts. The first method suits Snehapana and Rasayana bes’; the second suits Kashaya and other courses. Both methods are superior to all other methods in their effect. It is possible that a weak patient may not stand _ 420 Chikitsa Samgraham the strain of Pathya and the potency of the medicine. Other courses are open then. One is to take the medicine on an empty stomach before the evening meal. The effect may not be far less than the morning dose. In this method, even though the dose is small, it is better to take it one hour before the meal, rather than taking it just before the meal. After the dose and again after the meal, one should lie on the left side for a while. Some physicians say that variations in the —— of the doses according to ailments .afford better results. In Apana disorders, medicine is taken before the meal or with the first morsel. Samana disorders are controlled by medicines taken amidst meals. Vyana disorders are passified by doses taken immediately after the first morning meal. In Udana disorders, the medicine is taken immediately before closing the evening meal. For Prana disorders, repeated doses of medicine with every morsel of food is prescribed, including the last morsel.

For ailments above the neck, medicines are best taken after the last meal of the day, before bed. For regular bowel movement and for sexual energy, this is the best time. Fora purge, the time is between 5 to 6 in the morning after which sleep must be avoided. Medicine for inducing vomit is to be had mid- morning. For nourishment medicine must follow food; for di- gestion it can be before, during or after food. Medicines for the eyes must be applied before 8 a.m. or after 4p.m. Eye pack may be used any time. The view of experts is that medicines con- taining iron or arsenic are to follow food. When unable to make all these subtle distinctions, the best course is to take small doses before both meals. REGION: For obtaining best results, the selection of the region is as Seasona for Treatment 121 important a factor as the season. Moving to a very cold region for treating Vata or to a very hot region for treating Pitta is likely to be of no avail. On the other hand, if a Vata patient is taken to a hot region and a Pitta patient to a cold region, the diseases may abate possibly without any treatment. In medical science, regions are of three types. Area where water, trees and hillocks are less, is called \"Jangala\"; and the meat of the animals of such areas is called \"Jangala meat\". Areas where such features abound are called \"Anoopa\". Backwater areas and hill and mountains with dense forest are also included in this category. Jangala regions provoke Vata, while Anoopa’ regions provoke Kapha. Regions coming between these two categories are classified as \"ordinary\", and are ideal for carrying on all treatments. Regions of polluted air, and mucky or swampy or forest areas are not advised for treatment. Backwater areas lacking in pure water are to be avoided totally. Moderately wooded regions in rural areas with pure water, good vegetation, neat houses, pure air and - good people around are to be selected.

Patients who fall ill or whose illness aggravates in any region due to its being uncongenial should be shifted to regions of opposite characteristics and properly treated. Pathya (Regimen): Pathya is essential during treatment and while taking any medicines. The aim of Pathya is to eliminate the causes of the disease and set up a routine and other circumstances favourable for its cure. Avoidance of factors opposed to the special characteristics of some medicines and the acceptance of those increasing their potency is also an aim of Pathya. Pathya is also prescribed to regulate the mutually conflicting effects of some powerful medicines. Pathya is of two kinds, viz., (1) affable and (2) austere. The following 16 regulations apply to both types of Pathyas: 1. For bathing and washing and other purposes use boiled water after cooling it to tolerable warmth. Discard cold 122 10. 11. 12. 13. 14.

Don't stay awake after 10 p.m. Sleep is, however, taboo in cases of poisoning and some throat ailments. Avoid strenuous exertion. This is not applicable in obe- _Sity, Kapha diseases, adiposity and some kind of skin diseases. Excitement due to anger or.sorrow is to be avoided.

People and food not liked by the patient must not be allowed near. 16. Timings of medicines, food and other routine should be strictly observed. The rest of the daytime should be spent with friendly people in peace and listening to good stories, the narrators taking care that their stories are not exciting. The rule is that this discipline is to be observed —, out the period of the treatment and for as many days more as the days of the treatment. This should be observed generally by all those who are chronically ill or constitutionally weak. Itchha Pathya (Involving no harsh discipline) In ailments prolonged or not very serious, and when too weak to stand austere Pathya, Itchha pathya alone is prescribed. In such conditions, austere Pathya is likely to do more harm-than good. Therefore in these circumstances strong medicines are to be given with the utmost caution, and that too in small doses. All the rules given above apply to Itchha Pathya as far as possible. But one may take a little walk, and speak, and think on light matters. Only don't overdo it. Exposure to sun, fire, dew, rain and so on is taboo. Red chillies and fresh tamarind are to be minimised. Salt and old tamarind are not so objection- able in Vata. In Pitta all tastes except sweet, bitter and astringent are objectionable; Pungentt, bitter and astringent are recommended in Kapha. For purifying blood, tastes as for Pitta, and in adi- posity those for Kapha are acceptable. Rice from fresh paddy is to be avoided. Fresh jaggery, black gram, gingelly, wines and non-Jangala meats are all bad. Rice for cooking must be at least six months old. Wheat is also good. Shashtika rice is good in all cases. In diabetes old barley, millet, ragi and wheat are acceptable in any form; also Shashtika rice if a year old. In most cases generally various dishes made from limes, pumpkins, dif- ferent kinds of gourds, yams, plantains, mango pickled in salt, old tamarind, ginger, pepper, curry leaves, turmeric, old horsegram, buttermilk, ghee, old jaggery table salt, grapes, oranges and papad roasted can be used in small quantities.

Hot water bath may be had every two or three days. Those who feel discomfort, without a bath may bathe daily; in summer in the evenings all may bathe. A mid-day nap is allowable for those accustomed to it, and those exhausted from heavy work or excessive sex, the aged, children and those with asthma, hiccup, dysentery or indigestion or in acute pain or insanity. Kricchra Pathya (Involving very severe austerities) All the sixteen rules given above must be strictly ob- served. Further, the bedroom must not be exposed to direct draught of wind. Doors and windows may be opened only when essential. Don’t walk bare foot, and never step out of the room. Avoid going out for calls of nature, by using commode. If it cannot be avoided, protect the head and body fully with a sheet to avoid exposure to sun, rain and mist, and use a wooden sandal when going out, and return soon. Rice for eating must be in small broken grains, must be well washed and cooked and completely drained, and again kept over a soft fire, and eaten warm. Light roasting before cooking is preferable. Don't fill the belly. Leave belly empty for a couple of morsels, Rock salt may accompany food, though some object to even this. There is no need to even mention chilly and tamarind. One should not drink water, nor bathe. Milk also is generally taboo. When taking medicines containing mercury or sulphur and in the case of Bhasmas, ghee and milk are allowed moderately. In the case of other medicines when exceptionally thirsty, water boiled with the ingredients of those same medicines may be taken in very small doses. Body and head should be lightly covered even when stayng indoors.

It is only the experienced physician who can manage to administer medicines involving Austere Pathya. It is not uncommon that a mixture of the two types of Pathya is advised according to the intensity of the disease. If the medicine is taken in the morning, all Kricchra Pathya restrictions are observed in the morning; from the afternoon onwards affable Pathya is followed. This certainly makes the medicines more effective. But such ventures must always be in consultation with a competent physician. Dosage Dosage is determined in sucha way that maximum benefit is derived while no harm ensues. Medicine taken without fixed dosage will be as unpleasant as music without rhythm. Ancient masters did not unfortunately define dosage. We fixed the dosage in respect of our preparations on the basis of a compara- tive study of the dosage prescribed in modern works, and our own experience in laying down a well-defined formula and processing procedure and fixed the dosage. This has been included in our catalogues too. This dosage applies exclusively to our preparations. It will be wrong to consider our.dosage appropriate for the preparations of others due to the difference in manufacturing process. Our pills are generally rolled in single doses. Their dosage is not indicated unless there are exceptions. Our dosage applies to adults, between 20 and 60 years of age. In rare cases, children's dose is also given. Most medicines for adults can be given to children in doses modified as follows: A dose applies to an adult of 16. A sixteenth part of this is the dose for each year of his age, and a twelvth part of this division is the dose for each month of the year. Thus, if an adult dose is 64ml, a sixteenth part is 4 ml and the dose for a 2 year old is 8ml, for a 4 year old is 16ml and so on, adding 4 ml for each year, and fixing the dose for all ages. Similarly, a twelvth part of a 4ml (the dose for a one-year old child) which will be five drops, is the dose for a month-old child, 10 drops for a two- 126 Chikitsa Samgraham month old, and 30 drops for a six-month", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

Experience has shown that in special circum- stances like constipation or convulsions, a higher dose can be given. This will be harmful if left in inexperienced hands. The dose prescribed above can never be harmful. A higher and a- lower dose is given in our lists. It will be proper to start with the lower dose even for strong patients, and increase it gradually to the higher dose if constipation or other troubles do not show. If the dose prescribed is 60 to 250mg, the idea is to begin with 60mg and to raise it gradually to 250 mg. Due to personal idiocyncrasy, even the small dose may not suit some, and the highest may be inadequate for a few. Everyone is responsible to act on these instructions with due care. Only a half of a quarter of the lowest dose in the case of such potent items like mercury, arsenic, Indian hemp and opium is to be attempted first to be increased only after watching for 2 or 3 days carefully for any ill effects, and only when none is seen. Anupana (Adjuvants) A subsidiary item added to the main medicine either as a suitable vehicle, or to reduce its bad taste, or to increase its natural power or to modify it, is what is meant by \"Anupana\" here. This subsidiary item in most cases will be fluids like cold water, hotwater, cumminseed water, buttermilk (Plain or boiled), curd, whey, tender coconut water, wine, milk, breastmilk, oil, ghee and honey. The quantum is such that the medicine is neither too thin nor too thick after the mixing. Thus 30 to 120ml may be taken as suited, unless otherwise specified. Butter, ghee or honey may be added to bring the medicine to the Lehya consistency, say 4 to 16ml. Wherever a fluid is to be mixed with any medicine as prescribed in this list, this proportion holds good. If items like powdered jaggery, cumminseed water, dry ginger, cardamom or sugar are to be added to calxes; or oils, the commoner calls it \"Anupana’. In this sense the quantity should be 2 to 4 times of the medicine. This ratio applies to ~ butter and other such items too.

We advise only water purified by boiling or distilling for mixing with medicines. Thus wherever cold water is mentioned, only water boiled and cooled is meant. In this boiling, no medicines need be added. It should be drawn fresh in a clean vessel and boiled over a steady fire, without any foreign matter or insects getting into it at any time. Ginger water A litre of water with 7.5gm of dry ginger is to be boiled down to half a litre. Musta, cumminseed, coriander, greengram fried, sandal, vettiver, Khadira, Ekanayakam root or other items may be used in place of ginger. The process remains the same. This may be used hot or cooled as convenient. ' Cumminseed water This is made the way ginger water is made, but people modify this in different ways. Cumminseed and the stem of ripe jack leaves 30 grams are boiled in a litre of water down to a fourth and used in suitable quantities. This is superior to the others. Some add Bala also to make the 30 grams or 5 grams of dry ginger. None of these is harmful. For urgent purposes, it is enough if 10 grams of cumminseed is fried brown in a pan, about 170m! of water poured over it and kept covered for five minutes. Medicated buttermilk A litre of diluted buttermilk (one part good buttermilk and two parts water) with three grams of dry ginger and ajwan seeds is to be boiled down to two-thirds of a litre, removed from fire, topped with 3 grams of curry leaves and 1.5 grams of table salt, and properly cooled for use. Some add a pinch of turmeric 128 Chikitsa Samgraham which also adds to the colour. The roots of castor or Punarnava (Boerhaavia diffusa) may be substituted according to ailments.

Coffee Coffee is a drink made from the seeds, called Coffee seeds, of the plant originally imported from Africa, and now common in the country. There are two varieties, and physicians consider the smaller one the better of the two. This is fried brown in a pan with a smear of ghee. The frying should be uniform, and not excessive, and powdered coarse immediately. There is no need to powder fine. It should then be kept in a clean container, airtight.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TREATMENT Abhyanga (Inunction) The term 'Abhyanga’ is used as a synonym of oil bath; because inunction without bath is not common. This is advised to be.practised daily. There is no daily routine as beneficial as this for preserving youthfulness, allaying Vata troubles, for comfort of the eyes,toning up the body, sound sleep, softness and firmness of the skin,preventing skin diseases and for long life.

There is no need of repeating that it is prescribed for those for whom bath is not allowed. Inunction bath is contraindicated particularly for those with increased Kapha, indigestion and immediately after emesis or purging. Oil is anointed all over the body, specially on the head, in the ears and on the feet. One must not take bath immediately in a hurry after applying the oil, but should wait for sufficient time. The specific oil to be applied by each, differs as per the type of the disease or the temperament. Generally speaking for a person of Vata temperament medicated oils like Ksheerabala, Balaguluchyadi. Karpasastyadi etc., for Pitta, like Bhringamalakadi, Manjishtadi, Kayyanyadi etc. and for Kapha oils like Eladi, Asanavilwadi, Marichadi etc., can be suggested for application on the head. For applying on the body Dhanwan- taram kuzhampu, Balaswagandhadi kuzhampu and Vatamardhanam kuzhampu can be suggested for Vata, Pitta, Kapha temperaments respectively.

The leaves of Bala for Vata, leaves of Chaul Mugra for Pitta and the leaves of Hareetaki (Chebulic myrobalan) for Kapha are good. These shampoos are to be carefully washed away completely. If oil is still sticking, it has to be shampooed again. All other procedures are to be followed as instructed in the context of bath. Inunction would have to be done in certain conditions, where bath is not allowed. Under such conditions, the physician has to use his own discretion. Dhara Dhara is a method of the Kerala special treatment evolved from the genius of the medical tradition here. Many such distinctive and excellent forms of treatment, not practised in other parts of India, are conducted by the Kerala Physicians. Dhara is one amongst them and the most important. Aithough there are many physicians conducting this treatment, only a few manage it with a thorough understanding of its principles: To conduct a Dhara in the proper order is very difficult and expensive. To manage it properly without any omission or mishaps, the physician should be well studied and experienced. Besides, to select the suitable cases for Dhara, he must have good discre- tionary ability. , To speak the truth, Dhara is good for all diseases. Chang- ing the liquid as per the Dosha condition with necessary altera- tions in its process, it is useful to alleviate any Dosha. For instance, oils medicated with appropriate medicines in Vata, ghee pre- pared with Pitta healing medicines in Pitta and mere oils in 134 Chikitsa Samgraham Kapha-can be used. For a healthy man, Yamaka (mixture of oil and ghee) is preferred as per tradition. According to another version, the suitable liquid medium for Vata is unctuous liquids (as ails, ghees etc.) for Pitta milk and for Kapha buttermilk. Sometimes in Pitta diseases", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

There are varieties of Dhara. They are mainly grouped as Moordhanya (on the head), Sarvangeena (all over the body) and Pradesika (local). The most important of these is Moordhanya. It is employed in diseases like insanity, diseases of the head and eyes, chronic cold and sinusitis (Peenasa), diseases of the ear, mouth, Vata diseases etc. The second is Sarvangeena. It is to be done in Sarvangeena. Vata (Vata affecting the whole body), Sarvangeena Sopha (anasarca, swelling all over the body) etc. Pradesika or local Dhara comes as the third in importance. This is done locally in cases of rheumatoid arthritis, swelling, ascitis, abscesses, wounds etc.” Maordiianys inhawas. - Not only for Mibcidbenye Dharas but for all dharas many arrangements are:to be made neatly earlier. The following are the important of them. Dharapati or Droni The first requirement is the proper Droni. To make a proper Dharapati, many orderly steps are to be followed. The first one is the selection of the suitable wood. Many trees as Deodar, Pine, Punnaga (Calophyllum inophyllum) Mango tree and others are specially recommended for this. The ideal wood universally accepted by physicians is Nuxvomica. But the wood of Jack and Asana (Madras Kino Instructions for Treatment 135 wood) are also good. An average Dharapatti must be 55-80cm in breadth and 2.5 to 3 metres in length. On the head side the part that comes under the neck of the patient when lying, is elevated. Behind it there is a pit to which liquid flows when Dhara is conducted. There is a hole to the pit to.allow the liquid to flow out, so that the flow of the liquid to the part of the Droni where the’body rests, is prevented. The part of the Droni where the head rests should be low by 9-12cm. There should be an outlet on the foot side also to-allow the fluid to go out. Besides, there should be handles on all the four corners 12-24cm long. It is to help carry the patient conveniently from one-place to", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

The height of the supports is to be 24-36cm. The Droni for Sarvanga Dhara is to have its borders ‘higher than the other ones. Here the height of the supports also is to be altered. On the head side they should be higher and on the foot side lower. Dharachatti (the vessel for Dhara) Amongst the apparatus required. for a Dhara, one very essential is the Dhara vessel. It is to be made with the utmost care. It can be made with metals like gold, silver etc., but some liquids used for Dhara, may not agree with some metal contain- ers. So these vessels are usually made of clay which is the best and congenial to all alike. This vessel should contain at least 5.5 litres of liquid and so formed that the liquid is.drawn to the bottom from all sides evenly. Otherwise, when the vessel is moved to and fro, the liquid may overflow and the steady downward flow is hindered. There is no need for emphasising - that the vessel should be made of pure clay, well baked and made durable. The edge of the vessel is to be thick and turned outwards, so that it is easy to tie ‘a rope around it for hanging. A hole is bored in the very centre of this vessel. The circumfer- ence of this hole should be large enough to allow the insertion of the finger of the patient or anybody else. A wick of thread is pushed down through this hole along which the liquid is allowed to flow down. This wick'should be of well spun thread soft and even. This is to be tied ( in the form of a ring) in the 136 Chikitsa Samgraham middle of a strong stick, about 12cm in length. The stick is then placed inside the vessel and the wick is let down through the hole. To place a coconut shell, bored in the centre between the stick and the hole , is a practice among physicians. A coconut shell with regular slope is selected avoiding soft spots and is made smooth. The edge of this shell is serrated. The hole in the shell is aligned with that of the vessel. This shell is placed mouth downwards at the", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}
{"chunk_id": 107, "book": "chikitsa_samgraham", "text": "very centre of the vessel. The stick is fixed above the shell and the wick of the thread is allowed to pass down through the holes of the shell and the vessel. The benefit of this device is that, when the vessel, is moved to and fro, the range of the movements of the roll is controlled. If the stick is placed just inside the vessel above the hole with no coconut shell between them, the whole thread hanging down, swings uncon- trollably. Since there is space between the teeth of the coconut shell, there is no chance of any hindrance to the flow of the liquid. Along with this, another trick is also done. Between the shell and the vessels round pieces of plantain leaf (made soft by heating ) is put. This leaf is bored here and there at various spots. This helps regulate the speed and girth of the flow. In its absence, there is probability of forceful rush of the liquid down when refilling the vessel repeatedly. Fall of the liquid on the head, sometimes forcefully and sometimes feebly, may create troubles. ‘The edge of the vessel is to be wound with strong ropes and made ready for suspending from above. Dharadravam (the liquid: for Dhara) How to prepare the liquid for Dhara is our next concern. This is the most important item of Dhara. Dharas are named after the liquids employed for them. The effect of a Dhara mainly depends upon the quality of the fluid selected. So we have to separately deal with the liquids commonly used and with the differences in naming their varieties etc. Whatever be the fluid for the Dhara on the head, its quantity is to be not less. than 1800ml or more than 3600ml. Usually average of 2700ml is taken. Takradhara (Dhara with buttermilk) Although there are descriptions of many varieties of instructions for Treatment 137 Dhara, the most important among them in vogue is Takra Dhara. This is not simply with raw buttermilk as the name suggests. Dhara simply with raw buttermilk is very rare. Usually the buttermilk is mixed with the decoction of Amalaka (Embelic myrobalans) or some other liquids. The preparation of this buttermilk also has to be managed with special care. The tubers of Musta (Cyperus rotundus) outer skin removed, are taken in the ratio of 30gm/450ml of buttermilk, tied in bundle and put in", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

When boiling a steady and mild fire is to be maintained. Too much blazing or drying must be avoided. If the water is not removed completely, it may be the cause of many troubles. During boiling, the milk is to be stirred repeatedly. Even after removing the milk from the stove, the ladling is continued until it cools down. The ferment is put only when the milk is sufficiently cooled. On the first day, or- dinary buttermilk without any water is used as a ferment , since the medicated buttermilk prepared on the above lines is not available then. After adding the ferment it should be kept closed in a safe place and on the next morning the butter removed by churning well. The bundle of the medicines put in the milk earlier is squeezed well and removed when the boiling process is over. But some hold that the best time for its removal is only when the curd is churned. The quantity of milk required for next day*s Dhara fluid and also for preparing the ferment is to be collected and boiled. Besides Musta, other medicinal herbs like Chandana (Sandal wood), Useera (Vettiver), Madhuyashti (Liquorice) and Hribera (Coleus vettiveroides) are also put in the milk while boiling. Such choice is left to the direction of the physician. Whatever may be the number of medicines, the total quantity should not exceed the ratio of 30 grams for 450ml. Generally for all diseases, Musta is enough for the intended benefit. Ksheeradhara (Dhara with milk) This is done usually with ordinary good cow's milk. Fresh warm milk is used. If it is not practical, then milk cooked with medicines and cooled, is to be taken. The w.« to prepare medi- 138 Chikitsa Samgraham _ cated milk is already explained in the context of Takra Dhara.

Other medicines like Gorochana (Bezoar or Fel Bovinum purifeatum) ginger, aloes, vettiver and Marma gulika are used. These medicines can be added in boiled and cooled milk also. The quantity of milk to be stored should not be less than three litres. Sometimes, as per the Doshas, buffalo's milk etc., also are used for Dhara. Stanyadhara (Dhara with breastmilk) . It is done simply with human breastmilk. But it is rarely used without adding some medicines like Pacchakarpoora, Gorochana or Saffron. In selecting breastmilk, there are many things to be specially cared for. The breastmilk of those with any disease is to be avoided. It should not be taken from one who is hungry for a long time. The breastmilk of a woman just delivered, or with a grown-up child is also to be avoided. The milk of a woman in prime youth with a child neither a tender baby nor a grown-up, is to be taken into a clean vessel after cleaning the breast well. As soon as it is milked, the container, should be closed and kept well. The breastmilk loses its prop- erties if kept for more than three hours. The quantity of breast- milk for Dhara, is to be the same as for Ksheeradhara, but since it is very difficult to get, we may manage with whatever quantity is available. Snehadhara (Dhara with unguents) At present, Takradhara is more common in Kerala. But it is Snehadhara that has been more dealt with in Sastras. Almost all unctuous liquids are employed for this Dhara. But the important ones are oils, ghees, fats and marrows. These can be s instructions for Treatment 139 used singly or mingled as per the dosha conditions of the patient. These can be used raw or medicated. Medication can be done by boiling with medicines or mixing their powder in-it.. The quantity of the liquid should not however, be below 2700mk. The: unctuous liquids are heated generally and administered warm. Solidified liquids like ghee etc., are to be melted well before usirig. To melt or heat, the container itself is placed in hot water. The container is wiped dry.. When preparing the medicated oils for Dhara, its Paka ie., the stage at which it has to be removed from the oven, is like that of Sirovasti.

Regarding Dharas with other liquids like tender coconut water, Aranala, decoctions and pure water what is to be remembered is only that they should be collected and kept in the proper way. All-other things are as in the case of other Dharas. When doing Dhara with water, the vessel is refilled only with fresh water, ~ since water in plenty is always available. , Attendants The attender is the next important requirement for Dhara. There must be at least three of them. They are to be well trained, experienced in having worked together co-operatively, attentive, with love and attachment towards the patient so that he also likes them and feels confidence in their care and interest towards him. . The Physician In all treatments, the main part belongs to the physician. Dhara can never be done without him. The patient may have undergone many Dhara treatments earlier, the attendants may be well experienced and clever, still to start a Dhara in the absence of a physician is completely wrong. The physician being well-versed in the medical science and one with good experience in treatment, must have a thorough knowledge of the nature of 140 Chikitsa Samgrahani the patient. He must be intelligent and wise so that no mistakes are committed, and if anything goes wrong, he is able to rectify it immediately. Attention should be paid by him not only when Dhara is being done, but also in gathering the equipments and in the daily routine of the patient. Although not so important as the above, there are other minor things also to be prepared earlier. A bed sheet, pillow, a roll of cloth to tie around the head, pieces of cloth, a bath towel, a vessel to collect the Dhara liquid coming out from the Droni, two suitable receptacles to receive liquid and pour it again into the Dhara vessel, two or three small cups made of leaves, two or three small seats for the physician and attendants, a lamp with oil and wick, a time-keeper, oil for the head and kuzhampu or Trivritasneha for the body, herbal shampoo, water boiled with Amalaka for washing the head, powder of greengram or horsegram for removing the oil on", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

This is a temporary pillow prepared with soft cloth folded repeatedly. It is finally covered by a plantain leaf made soft by heating. This leaf cover prevents wetting and since it extended to the top of the Dharadroni, the liquid is allowed to flow freely to the pit of the Droni, from where it is let out. The length, height and thickness of the pillow are adjusted for the comfortable testing of the head during Dhara. Carelessness in this may cause many troubles. Pillows can be made of very soft leather or oil cloth. This pillow is to be used only at the time of Dhara. At other times the ordinary pillow is enough for use.

The quantity for immediate use is taken in another pot or cup. Take care to wipe this cup well before use. If wet, it may cause troubles. Generally Bhringama- lakadi tailam, Manjishtadi tailam, Asanavilwadi tailam, Triphaladi _ tailam, Chandanadi tailam (Big), Tungadhrumadi tailam and Balaguluchyadi tailam are taken for this purpose.

But in these matters, it will be better to consider the comfort of the patient also. For some people, the fall of the liquid from 5cm height may be intolerable. For others, the fall from too low a position may be disagreeable. Some patients like a thick flow, while others a thinner one. These differences in reaction may be due to the difference in temperaments. Sometimes it may also be due to the difference in Doshas. For instance, in Pitta, a low fall, but with more thickness is beneficial. A patient with Kapha temperament may like the fall from a higher position. A 146 Chikitsa Samgraham speedy flow also is appreciated by him. Different liquids also can create this change in reactions. We have to observe closely and judge accurately. A fall from a higher position causes headache, fever, burning sensation etc. Too low a fall not only fails to alleviate the disease, but some- times even aggravates the condition. A speedy flow provokes Vata and creates headache, swoon etc. If too slow, Kapha is increased and heaviness of the head is felt. The disturbance created by using too thick a fall is the same as due to increase in height and slow flow. Too thin a fall fails to give any good result. On the contrary, it causes, cold. One has to closely observe and understand these changes. Various other aspects like viscidity are to be considered carefully. Thus, until the scheduled time is over, all have to do their work earnestly and carefully and the patient is to lie still. He is not to turn on his sides, but lie supine. Such necessities as urination etc.,should not arise during this time. If it becomes unavoidable, it should be done into a urinal in the lying position without any movement of the head.

Usually the time for the course of dhara is either fourteen or twentyone days. But there is no objection in extending or re- ducing the duration as per the condition of the patient. Such discretion is the responsibility of the physician. Well considered decisions are always welcome. But prolongation of the Dhara time to more than one and a half hours is unnecessary, incon- venient and objected to by the Sastras. In unavoidable cir- cumstances, competent physicians resort to extension of the number of days: There is also a version that the maximum time allowed is only three Nazhikas, (75 minutes).

These must be made of mud. Otherwise, the vessel may not agree with the various liquids for Dhara. These pitchers are all of the same size and their nozzles wide enough to accom- modate one 's little finger. Special care is to be taken to clean this pitcher well. The nozzles should be well probed with sticks to clean them and to ensure unhindered flow. The quantity of the liquid for this Dhara must be plentiful and in any case never less than from Prastas. Sixteen Prastas is the optimum quantity required. The liquid is to be poured from the four pitchers simultaneously. Of these, one pitcher is to pour the liquid on the left upper starting from the umbilicus up to the neck and also on the left arm. Another one similarly is for the right side. Again one, for pouring on the left side from the umbilicus down on to . the left and the other one as counterpart for the right side also. Four pitchers also are to be filled and kept ready to replace these when empty. So altogether eight pitchers are required. Four attendants are needed for working with the pitchers and an- other two to setup the pitchers duly filled to replace the empty ones. So altogether six attendants are to be engaged. But some people manage Dhara with two pitchers. But this is not recom- mended. In such a procedure the arrangement is that one attends to the upper part of the body from the umbilicus and the other to the lower part; or else each attending to", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

Sometimes he has to lie face downwards, and sometimes on sides, so that the Dhara easily covers all parts of the body uniformly and evenly. But if Dhara on the head is also included, these changes of position may create inconvenience. For Dhara on the head, turning of the sides is improper. This is also in- convenient. In such cases, at first the patient is to lie face downwards and in this position the Dhara is done on the back for some time. Then turn supine and continue Dhara on the front side and on the head for the fixed time. After finishing the Dhara on the head, again lie on the belly and repeat Dhara on the back. The total time of two Dharas on the back is to be roughly the same as the time for the Dhara on the other parts. Massaging with hands every now and then is advised in Dhara of the body also.

Ekangadhara (Dhara on one limb or at a locality) Ekangadhara does not have many paraphernalia and procedures. But as per the difference in parts, some alterations may become necessary. Often these are done with various liquids commonly employed in Dhara on the head or Sarvangadhara (Sometimes with liquids not so commonly employed also). The important ones are various decoctions and juices of certain raw herbs. In some cases cold or warm water is also made use of. ‘The quantity of the liquid and other things are settled as per locality.

Here, appli- cation of oil on the head is not necessary. These can be done as per convenience in a sitting or lying position. Strict time limit is also not applicable here. Dhara in the eyes This is not done for a long time. The usual practice is to pour 101 leaf cupfuls of the liquid in both eyes and then stop. (Jack leaves are folded into cups for this purpose). Even if only one eye is affected, Dhara is to be done in both eyes. In some exigencies, 200 to 300 repetitions are also admitted. Tradition is against further increase. While Dhara on the other parts of the body is done with pitchers or other vessels, it is done in the eyes only with leaf cups as described above. A hole is made in the bottom of the cup just passable for a thin coconut leaf stalk. 150 Chikitsa Samgraham It is through this hole that the liquid is allowed to flow down in the-eyes. The maximum height of the fall allowable is only two fingers (5cm). In the case of other local Ekangadharas, there are no such restrictions. The height of the fall is adjustable as per the convenience and comfort of the patient. Where jack leaves are not available, some spoons or other things not exceed- ing one ounce capacity are bored, so as to have a small hole and used for this purpose. Any how, the liquid is allowed to fall down only through small hole. Pouring with the leaf cup itself is prohibited. Because in that case there won't be an even flow of the liquid. The liquid used for one eye is not allowed for the other. And special care is to be taken not to allow any drop to spatter and fall in the other eye when Dhara is simultaneously done in both eyes, as this may cause spread off the disease from the affected eye to the other.

Pizhichil This is only a modified form of Sarvangadhara. But only unctuous liquids are used for it. Since it is not possible for a common man to take such a huge quantity of oil daily, this method was devised by our old physicians to get the same effect with a reduced quantity. Usually the quantity is four measures (One measure-480ml). As in the case of Dhara of the body, this also is performed by four attendants, each managing ~ the part. allotted to him. Folded old cloth, as broad and thick as their palms, are supplied to each. The fifth attendant is for - heating the oil and supplying it to the others. As in the case of Dhara of the head, after anointing the head with the prescribed oil, the warm Kuzhampu (Trivrita sneham) is applied all over the body. After massaging the body for a while ‘in a sitting position, the patient is laid in the Droni.

If it is allowed to flow out, it will lead to waste. The Kuzhampu is to be changed on each day. The best way is not to use the Kuzhampu again which is once used. But in cases, where there are no wounds, skin diseases, or diseases with dirty discharges, the usual practice in Kerala allows taking the clear part of the Kuzhampu of the previous day and adding to it some fresh quantity to bring it to the required measure.

Duties after Dhara At least five minutes before the completion of Dhara all attendants should be particularly vigilant. Everything for the next step, like bath towel etc., are to be kept ready. Refilling the Dhara vessel is to be stopped some seconds earlier before the exact stopping time. At the exact moment, stop Dhara by drawing the vessel back. Then wipe the head with the towel. This is not to be done by the patient himself to avoid any shaking. After wiping well, same oil applied earlier is again smeared. In Sarvangadhara the body is to be wiped and oil applied. Then he may take bath as usual. But Amalaka water for the head and warm water for the body are indispensable. But for some people warm water may not be agreeable. For them cold water for the body may not be harmful. To remove the oil from the body, pasted greengram, horsegram etc., and the head, shampoos of leaves like Vellila({Mussaenda “rondosa) which are neither too cold nor too hot in potency are used.

NASYA (Errhines) Nasya is as important as any of the courses of Ayurvedic treatment. This is more or less essential in all ailments above the neck. Its efficacy is no less in the ailments of the lower body too. It is doubtful if there is any other treatment as. efficacious as Nasya, not only for immediate results but even as a permanent cure for terrible diseases like swooning, delirious fever, hemiplegia, Apatantraka, Bahyayama, Antarayama, facial pa- ralysis and Apabahuka, not to mention diseases of the head.

As nose is the outlet for the respiratory. channel, “ also alleviates all ailments originating in it. Nasya is divided into three types. The first is Virechana (purgative) which drains out the Doshas inthe nasal passage and the throat and relieves the head of its heaviness. This-can be done in many diseases like headache allied to Kapha, dullness of brain, Abhishyanda (discharge from nose), throat’ diseases, swelling affecting all parts above shoulder, mumps, vermination (above neck), tumours, skin diseases, epilepsy and chronic catarrh.

The 156 Chikitsa Samgraham third is Samana (palliative) and is neither nourishing nor reduc- ing, but is just palliative. This is adopted mostly in cases like black patches on the face, black moles, breaking and falling hair and chronic eye diseases.

This should not be done on those who have just had their food and those who have bathed their head or are about to bathe: also before one has come to the normal diet after blood- letting. It is despicable when the calls of nature are pressing. In post-natal cases and fresh cases of cough and asthma and for those who have had Vamana, Virechana or Vasti, this is not to be done, This is to be avoided when it is cloudy or when the sky is not clear during non-rainy seasons. However, these re- strictions are not to be observed strictly in emergent cases that can only be cured by Nasya. Timing The time of Nasya is to be altered to suit the Dosha and the season and other factors. Thus when Kapha is extremely excited, Nasya is to be done within four hours of day-break. In Pitta cases, midday is the best time and in Vata evening or night. Nasya (Errhines) * 157 For the healthy also it is the morning. This, however, is to be modified to suit thé season.

Dosage Varying dosage is prescribed according to the strength of the patient and type of medicine. For Nasya with Sneha, the high dose is ten drops, medium eight drops and low six drops. Subject to minor variations depending on the medicines, this _ same dose applies in the case of herbal juices, decoctions and ~ breastmilk. For paste and powders, the dose is two drops less than that of Sneha. A drop is the equivalent of one drop obtained. after dipping the patient's index finger upto two joints in oil.

VAMANAM (Emesis) Ancient masters divided treatment generally into two types, one purificatory and the other pacificatory. It is to puri- fication that they gave greater prominence. They did this on the basis that a Dosha once cured by pacification may circumstan- tially be provoked again, whereas it cannot ever do so once it is totally expelled from the system by purification. Purificatory treatment has been prescribed separately for © each Dosha. Vamana is intended for the removal of Kapha dosha. However, this is not to be adopted in mere Kapha only but, necessarily in case of Kapha's conjunction with one Dosha (Samsarga) or with both other Doshas (Sannipatam).: The following ailments and occasions render vomiting more or less essential. When any poisonous matter is consumed, whether knowingly or not, vomiting is to be induced urgently. This will often have to be done, if bitten by poisonous creatures like snakes; also when hit by poisonous weapons like arrows. In food-poisoning, Vamana becomes inescapable. When incompat- ible items of food are eaten, immediate vomiting is beneficial. ‘When food stays inside undigested, vomiting ‘brings immediate relief to the consequent troubles. Judicious vomiting has been found effective in cases. of ‘cholera which may be a-variety of indigestion and in Alasaka and in Grahani. For fever immedi- ately following meals, vomiting is essential.

Those keen on exercise, copulation, study or contemplation are to be excused from this. It is wrong to induce vomiting in children, the aged, weak, exhausted one whose digestive fire is overactive, those who are about to start or have just finished long walks; travelling or load-carrying, those in- jured in the chest or are heart patients, the obese,.the uncon- scious, those not used to free unobstructed vomiting, the consti- pated and those who have not come to normal diet after Vasti with Kashaya or Sneha.

On such occasions, one must have planned suitable remedial action for all emergent situations before inducing vomiting. Procedure Though Emesis can be resorted to in emergent cases any time, the suitable periods according to Kerala climate are the months of Tulam (October-November), Kumbham (February- March) and Karkidakam (July-August). The patient must first be oleated and then sweated. When these two have been completed successfully, he can be made to vomit the next day. It is necessary to excite the Kapha in him the previous night by feeding him with plenty of black gram, gingely or fish. He must sleep well in the night. Check if the previous night's food is well digested. Any prayers and propitiations may also be done. Breakfast may not be eaten, but if the state of unction is unsat- isfactory, some gruel may be taken with ghee. In the case of aged, children, exhausted and those who cannot stand strain, fill their belly with wines or meat or milk or sugar cane juice, choosing the item according to the ailment. Others also may take these liquids with benefit. After all this the patient sits facing the East and consumes, or is fed by the physician in the prescribed dose the medicine prepared to suit his ailment. Some rocksalt and honey are added to the medicine as a rule. For the next hour, he must wait expectantly for vomiting. It is convenient to sit on a knee-high chair, with protection from falling over. When nausea appears, encourage vomit by tickling the throat gently with the fingers or a soft rubber tube. This should not cause any pain or hurt, in the throat. Also don't strain or exert pressure to vomit and don't restrain it when it comes.

Vomiting is good in Pitta also, though not quite as good as in Kapha: hence this stipulation. In cases of pure Vata, vomiting is not to be done, but when Kapha is mixed with 166 Chikitsa Samgraham Vata, vomiting is common and the medicine for it should be unctuous, warming and salty. Vomiting should go on only until Pitta is seen mixed in the vomit or Kapha is totally absent ac- cording to the masters. If the urge reduces before this stage, the patient should drink salt water or goosebery (Amalaka) water or water mixed with mustard paste or long pepper, so that the vomiting continues. If even this does not help in some cases, the patient must be made to vomit another day, or other remedial measures taken after due consideration. Not vomiting at the due time after consuming the medi- cine, the dose of medicine alone being brought out, interrupted vomiting, in small quantities, starting in time but stopping before all Doshas are brought out, are all due to “Ayoga\" (inadequate conjunction). This may give rise to discomforts like watering of the mouth, expectoration, itching, scabies and fever. Uninter- rupted vomiting, first Kapha and then Pitta and lastly clean air is what happens in “Samyagyoga\" or proper conjunction. ‘Ati-yoga’ (excess conjunction) results in frothy and many hued vomit, in addition to the flow of Kapha and Pitta, blood, ex- haustion, burning sensation, dry mouth, giddiness, fainting, burstirig of throat, catches and severe Vata ailments also. Exces- sive flow of blood may cause even death. It is due to these risks that physicians nowadays are averse to this treatment. But some caution precludes all risks. In inadequate conjunction, the remedy is to administer the medicine again and in excess conjunction treat him as for the disease \"Vomiting\". With an optimum dose, the patient generally vomits eight times, for a medium dose six times and for a low dose four. It is important to bear in mind that this reckons only after the initial one or two vomits which bring out the medicine. .

For those with good digestion, this may be broken rice properly cooked, taken with ‘Rasa’ (a thin jeera soup). For the others, the procedure given in 'Peyadikrama’ described below is to be followed. Peyadikramam (Return to normal diet) Acharyas have described this variously. Charaka's view given below is considered the most acceptable. The first meal after a Vamana should be thin gruel of broken rice, which is old (not fresh), from the varieties of Sali or Arya. Shashtika variety is good. Fresh rice and others, which are harmful, are to be avoided. The second and the third meal is to be the same. It is from the fourth meal that 'Vilepi' (the thicker gruel) may be taken for the next three meals. It should be followed by warm water. Oily items are better avoided, but according to digestion a little may be taken. Rice meal from the above variety may be taken from the seventh meal onwards, but it must be well cooked and properly drained and shall not exceed 250 grams, in other words half the usual quantity. The meal must be followed by a drink of warm water. Thin gravy of plain green gram (Yusha) without much oil may be used with the meal. This can continue for the eighth and nineth meals. Soup from light meat (of birds) may be added from the tenth meal. Again, follow it with warm water. The eleventh and the twelfth meals should be the same. Normal meal can start from the thirteenth meal, i.e., from the seventh day. Slight variations may be introduced in the different meals of each group. The thin gruel of the first three meals should not be suddenly replaced by 'Vilepi' gruel for the fourth.

On the other hand a sudden change is not permissable, Vagbhata has some modifications to this procedure. Here the same type of food is repeated for all the three meals. According to him, such a course is to be followed only by those who had emesis with the 168 Chikitsa Samgraham maximum dose of medicine. But in the case of those who.had emesis with a moderate dose, each dietetic order can be limited to two meals only and to those with low dose of medicine for emesis each step ta one course alone. Such an altered procedure of the course is sufficient for our purpose, according to him. Susruta suggests horsegram and pigeon pea also in the place of green gram. Digestive ingredients like ginger, pepper and rock salt may be added a little from the beginning. This Peyadikrama procedure is not only to be followed after Vamana, but after all purificatory courses. This will have to be adopted aften for those exhausted from diseases and whose digestive fire is enfeebled by ‘Langhana' treatments. Whatever be the reason, great Sages further stipulate that this procedure is to be followed whenever the body and the digestive fire become weak. The advantage of following the \"Peyadikrama\" after a purificatory treatment is revealed in the stanza from Ashtamgahridayam.

The main difference is that its impartance is mainly in Pitta. In Kapha too, this is more or less effective. In Vata this is not so good but is resorted to circumstantially.

Acute stage of fever, weak indigestion, downward haemother- mia, wounds in the anus, diarrhoea, foreign bodies in the system, not returned yet to normal food after Vasti with Kashayam, very hard bowels and in excessive unction. In consumption also it may turn harmful. Even in these contra-indicated cases, if purging becomes inevitable in emrgent situations this may be done with all due precuations. Procedure Unless, contra-indicated, Vamana is prescribed before Virechana. If this is not done, Kapha may go down and enfeeble digestion and cause other disturbances. After vomotting, don't purge for fifteen days. Whether vomitting has been done or not, proper unction and sweating have to be done afresh. When all 170 Chikitsa Samgraham this is completed, the medicine prepared with due regard to the bowel peculiarities and ailments, may be taken. Most Acharyas say that the time for taking the medicine is four hours after the dawn. This is because, in the morning cool, the medicine may become inactive inside and at noon Pitta turns favourable for purging. The practice in Kerala however, is to take the medicine at 5 a.m. In other than cold seasons this cannot be faulted. It is sufficient if the body is protected from cold. If the abdomen is Pitta-dominated, soft items like milk, grapes or Aragvadha (Cassia fistula) give a good purge. Vata-dominated bowels are called hard. In such cases, even strong medicines like the root of Nagadanti (Baliospermum montanum) or Euphorbia milk(Common Milk Hedge) hardly produce a purge. The nature of the patient's bowel determines the medicine and its dose. In cases of excessive Pitta, astringent and sweet medicines are used, in Kapha bitter ones and in Vata cases if it becomes necessary, oily, heat producing and salty medicines are to be used.. If the patient does not purge in the usual time, he must drink hot water and sweat his abdomen with a hot water bag or bottle. However, he must drink cold water if he taken croton seeds for the purgation. If even this does not produce a good purge, take a light meal that day and take the medicine the next day, again.

The drawback of the previous occassion should be kept in mind when the Virechana is repeated. If the medicine is taken at dawn, lie down well covered, and donot sleep. Exposure to cold or sleep reduces the potency of all purgatives. After taking the medicine, don't walk about or do some work or think seriously. When the urge appears, get up slowly and go to the bathroom or use a commode nearby. Walking to a far-away place, and straining to produce a motion are serious errors. . A feeling that the chest and abdomen have not been Virecanam(Purging) 171 cleared, lack of appetite, displacement of Kpha and Pitta, itching, burning (due to indigetion), boils., catarrh, constipation and flatus obstruction are all symptoms of an inadequate conjunction. If the patients feels the opposite ofall this and is light and com- fortable a proper conjunction is indicated. In this case faeces, Pitta, Kapha and gas must be discharged in that sequence. In excess conjunction after all these discharges a simple fluid will be continue to be discharged, without Kapha or Pitta. The fluid may be white, black, bloody, or like water in which meat is washed. It may also be like loose flat. There might be anal prolapse, thirst, giddiness, or sunken eyes gradually. In addition all the troubles following excess conjunction in vomitting may occur here. In inadequate conjunction the remedy is to repeat purging and in excess conjunction it is the same as for diarrhoea or cholera. In less serious cases of excess conjunction, rice mixed in very sour curd or buttermilk will give immediate relief. But this is not good for digestion. In purging , optimum dose must produce 30 motions,an average one 20 and a small dose 10. Another view is that what is purged must be 4,2 and 1 Prasta respectively without reconing the first two or three motions. When the purging is over, the same procedure as after a vomiting must be followed, expect that no more smoking is to be done. 'Peyadikrama' is to be followed until one comes to the normal food.

VASTI Vasti predominates the \"five course treatment\" (Pan- chakarma). This is prescribed for Vata-dominated patients, and overcomes all diseases, rivives Ojah and rejuvenates the body. Experts claim that no disease is incurable by Vasti. Vasti is of \"two types: with decoctions and with oils ie., with Kashayas and Snehas. Snehavasti in small dose is called Matravasti. There are many Vastis like Kala, Karma, Yoga, Prasritika, Sodhana, Sa- mana, Lekhana and Brimhana according to the difference in the number, the order, dose, duration and material. All these however, come under one of the above two types. 'Uttaravasti’ also falls under them. Vasti is the process of injecting the fluid material through the anal, urinary or vaginal channel.- The main items required are Vastiyantra (the instrument) and the fluid. Vastiyantra has a bag for holding the fluid and nozzle for inject- ing the fluid. The nozzle is made of metal, horn, tooth, bone, wood or bamboo, shaped like a cow's tail and very smooth, and its head well rounded. Its length varies with the age of the . Patient. For an adult above 20 years it should be twelve fingers (of the patient) in length, for a child of 1 year five fingers, to 5 years six fingers, 7 to 12 years seven fingers, 12 to 16 years eight fingers and 17 to 19 years nine fingers. Its base should be as thick as the thumb and its forward end as thick as the little finger.

At the forward end the hole should be the size of a green gram, a blackgram, a dry Bengalgram and jujube seed according to the schedule.. The nozzle should have a rib about 3 fingers from the forward end to prevent it from slipping inside and two ribs of two fingers apart at the base for tying up the Vasti bag. The bag is made out of the bladder of buffalo or goat or of leather. It can also be made of water-proof cloth. The bag 174 Chikitsa Samgraham is attached to the base of the nozzle, by tying it between the flanges. . Procedure The fluid for Vasti is either decoction or oil prepared to suit the ailment. Vasti with unctuous oils is called 'Snehavasti' or Anuvasana and that with decotion is 'Niruha' or Asthapana. In all Vata cases, Snehavasti brings good results. Its power is remarkable in extreme dryness and in Atyagni (uncontrolled digestive fire). It is, however, contra-indicated in diabetes, anaemia, diarrhoea, enlarged spleen, catarrh, hard bowels, Abhishyanda, Oorustamba, obesity, emaciation, filaria and goitre as also in cases where Niruha is disallowed and also before food. Snehavasti On the morning of the appointed day, the patient must be inuncted with oil all over. The head should be washed with lukewarm water and the body with warm water. After auspi- ‘cious rituals, he should eat a hearty, austere and light meal, not too oily nor too dry, and not more than a fourth of the usual quantity. Any suitable drink may follow. After pacing about a while and satisfying all calls of nature he is to lie down on the cot on his left side, the left leg stretched out and the right ‘leg folded in front. The Vasti bag with the base of the nozzle attached to it is now filled with the lukewarm Vasti fluid. Don't forget to plug the forward hole of the nozzle with a cloth wick -before filling, so that the fluid does not drain away. Smoothen the anus and the nozzle eye with oil, remove the plug from the hole closing it with a finger, let out any trapped air, and press the bag to let in the fluid uniformly without interruption,until some fluid is still left in the bag so as to prevent any air from getting in.

The physician now gently taps the patient's buttocks, rubs upwards and raises his legs few times so as to raise the waist. The patient still lying on his back, may also tap his buttocks with his heels. The aim of all this is to prevent the fluid from flowing out too soon. There is no harm if the fluid remains Vasti 175 inside upto nine hours. If it comes out immediately, the process must be repeated. The effectiveness of the Vasti is indicated if the fluid stays inside for the intended period and comes out well mixed with all faeces and air. In the case of those with hard bowels, the flow-out may not be in time and for removing the oil, a medicated suppository or a strong acute Vasti may have to be resorted to. Such patients must avoid food the previous night and may drink some water boiled with dry ginger in the morning. On the third day, do a Snehavasti. Vasti with decoc- tion should be done only after two or three Snehavastis. Kashayavasti (Vasti with decoction) - This is an important course in difficult cases of Vata. This is also called Niruha or Asthapana. This Vasti controls many ailments like Raktavata, Gulma, Anaha (distended stomach), Sudhatisara (simple diarrhoea), Pinasa (chronic catarrh), Jirnajwara (chronic fever), calculus, impurities of semen and menstrual flow, obstruction to flatus; urine, faeces and semen, lack of breastmilk, spleen disorders and many types of pains. This is harmful in the cases of Amatisara (acute diarrhoea) emaciation, chest lesions, vomiting, asthma, watering in the mouth, piles, hiccup, enfeeblement of digestive fire, anal wounds, ascitis due to bowel obstructions, ascitis, skin diseases and diabetes and also in cases of excessive oleation. For expectant mothers, this is contra-indicated until the eighth month, as well as for those who have not come back to the normal routine after Vamana, Virechana and Nasya. This should not be done immediately after meals. Kashayavasti is to be done about mid-morning, say 10 a.m. After inunction and sweating, when the patient is a little hungry. The procedure is the same as for Snehavasti. If the fluid is not discharged within an hour, remedial action is called for either by the \"Vartti' (suppository) method, or by repeating-the Kashayavasti.

The symp- toms of excessive, moderate and inadequate conjunction in this case also are the same as in Virechana. Uttaravasti The nozzle for this is different for males and females. For males this should be 30cm. long and 6mm. thick, with rings at the base in the middle. The end should be smooth with the hole of the size of a mustard seed. For females, it should be about 25cm. long and the hole, the size of a green gram. It can enter about 5cm. into the urethral and 10cm. into the vaginal channels. In the case of girls, this is done only through the urinary channel and the nozzle can enter about 2.5cm. Generally this is relevant only to urinary ailments, but in the case of females to uterus- vaginal ailments also. It is stipulated that this is to be done only after the bowels are cleared. Male patients should be made to sit ona knee high stool. After Srotasuddhi (clearing the passage) the nozzle is to be inserted into the bladder through the urinary channel and the Vasti carried out. Females should lie on their back and draw up their legs and the Vasti is to be done in the bladder or the uterus. After this, bathing and eating are as for Snehavasti. Matravasti This is resorted to for appeasing excited Vata and for regularising bowel movements. This is excellent for increasing vigour and is very favourable to the young, the aged, sex addicts, physical culture enthusiasts and the delicate. This has no restric- tions as in oleation, sweating, vomiting and purging and no austere Pathya. This can be done daily after midday meal with a low dose of 25 to 100ml. of the fluid (the dose that can be digested within 6 hours). It is enough if the usual ‘enema can' is used for this purpose.

After watching for any. trickle of the oil, apply the blackgram paste at the lower end of the cap so that any oil poured in the head does not trickle down. By now the helpers must have the oil just agreeably warmed up and ready. It should not be boiled again but only warmed up slightly, but not too warm. When all is ready, pour the oil slowly over the head after ensuring the head is held straight. The oil level must reach about one finger above the crown. The remaining oil must be kept over a slow fire, so that it does not lose heat. Remember that it is dangerous to have the oil more than comfortably warm. As the oil over the head cools off, remove it by soaking it up in the piece of cloth and replace it with warm oil. This process is to be kept up, till the end.

It is worth mention here that some experienced physicians extend this upto 90 min. without any ill effect. Their view is that vasti is to be continued until Kapha loosens and starts draining out through the nose and mouth and that it is to be stopped when this starts. If this starts before the fixed time, Vasti must be stopped. When the time is over the oil must be removed quickly with cloth or jack leaf and the cap and bands untied and removed.

Unclean habits may end up in a terrible disease and even be a bother to the others. Every healthy person must bathe daily out of habit. This is a routine that makes for a healthy body and a happy mind. The guidelines for the routine are discussed below. Firstly bathe at dawn or dusk. Midday bath is deplorable. Bathig both times is a pleasant routine. The water must be clean and light. Not only the water but even the sur- roundings must be clean. Before bathing, clean the mouth and all orifices with great care. It is no use bathing without removing all impurities with gram paste or other cleaning agents. All underclothes and garments must be washed clean. The best:is to take bath in a river or a clean pool. If this cannot be done, pour water over the body and bathe.

It can be said that oleation should procede and succeed all courses of treatment. The following types of patients particularly need oleation. Those starting Swedana and Sodhana courses cannot avoid it. Those affected by Roughness (Rooksha) especially need this. It is hard to cure Vata patients without proper Snehana. Those indulging in Excessive drinks or sex or exercise or worrying, aged, children, anaemic, emaciated, weak by nature, those afflicted by Vata or semen loss, must resort to Snehana in particular. Snehana is not to be tried on those with weak digestive fire, with excessive fire or the obese, those exhausted with Vata diseases named Oorustamba, or indigestion or throat aliments artificial poison ascitis, diarrhoea, lack of appetite, faints, vomiting, Kapha or excessive thirst; also those intoxicated by alcohol.

Selection of the unguent needs great care with referance to the different in Dosha and disease. To put it concisely, Ghritam is to be used in Pitta, Tailas in Vata and if necessary in Kapha Snehanam (Oleation) 185 too. The other two are important in Vata the difference being that the choice of fat and marrow will depend on the properties of the flesh of the animal. Many tailas and Ghritas have been described in this text. The suitable one from among them may be selected on the basis of the nature and state of the illness. The method of taking Ghritam is described in brief in the chapter on Ghritas. For unmedicated ghee also the method is the same. Medical opinion is that whichever be the Sneha, if taken before the meals , it cures the ailments of the lower body amidst the meals, the middle sad and at the end of the meals the upper body. While taking Snehas and for an equal period after that, all diet restrictions must be observed. In the case of small doses, such care is not so essential. In major ailments, in addition to taking Sneha it must also be used in other ways like inunction for quick oleation of the system. The various methods like Abhyangam, Sekam (Dhara) Pizhichal, Pichu and Sirovasti have all been described seprately, with producers for the respective courses. In the case of the exhausted and those who cannot follow diet restrictions, it is enough to take the Ghritam prepared to suit the desease with meals or a little before meals in small doses (i.e., as much as one usually takes with meals and can be well digested) and a daily Abhyanga may also done. The benefits may be delayed, but there is no fear of any risk. In emergent cases, Snehanam can be achived by the following methods: a) Take soup of meat (of faty variety) with plenty of ghee, b) take rice cooked in such soup with seasoning in ghee, c) Take gruel cooked in milk hot with ghee, d) Take the cream of curd with jaggery,", "source": "chikitsa_samgraham_page_unknown"}

The fifth fetches 4 of the Shastika bundles heated in the milk-decoction mixture. After checking with their palms that the bundles are agreeably hot, the four attendants start massaging with them. They must touch the patient's body with the bundles and remove them once or twice and then start fomentation gradually. If too hot, it may scald, if not hot enough it will be less effective. The movement must always be downwards. Often press the body with the bundle. In the affected areas this should be done with special care. Massage will have to be across and upwards sometimes accord- ing to the direction of the nerves. First the patient must lie on his back, then on the sides and the belly for the massage, many times over, during the course. The attendants’ hands must not leave any area untouched. Excessive massage in some areas, less in other places and not at all elsewhere may do harm later. Massage must cover all parts of the body and the face except the area covered by hair. Massaging in this area too may be useful in Vata of the upper body. The first 4 bundles lose heat by now. It is the duty of the fifth attendant to supply the four warm bundles and take the cold ones and heat them in the boiling fluid for the next change. The physician is responsible to see that the heat is maintained uniform throughout by changing the bundles and that the massaging covers all parts of the body.

But it is heat-producing items which are to be avoided after Dhara; while after Pindaswedam it is cooling items that must be discarded, according to the nature of the disease. General pathya restrictions too are similar. : Pindasweda can be done not only with Shashtika but also with other grains like wheat, blackgram, horsegram, mustard, fenugreek and dill. These grains are often mixed even with Shashtika. Pindaswedam is likely to be more beneficial if mutton, chicken, bacon or other meat is added, in some cases. Whatever be the items used, the fluid will be the same, though Dhanyamla and other items may also be used. Like Dhara, this is also done for 14 to 21 days depending on the severity of the case and strength of patient. This can be limited to any part of the body also.

Before any Sweda generally, internal oleation must be done and oil applied outside at the time of fomentation. The rule is that the fluid and all other materials must be made unctuous by mixing oil. For Kapha-dominated patients,*oil need not be applied, nor the fomentation made unctuous. If Kapha and Vata are excited the body need not be oiled, but fomentation must be unctuous. What is to be understood is that unction, is especially required in Vata, but does not suit Kapha. It is im- portant to note that Sweda is never done in a room that is not protected against wind. If the aches and the cold feeling disappear and a soft feeling in the limbs and a mild sweat appear, the Sweda is taken as properly done.

When the digestive fire lacks the power to digest the normal food, or its digestion is long delayed, it is Agnimandyam. ' The consequent troubles generally are heaviness of stomach, moving Vayu in the abdomen, various sounds in the bowels, loss of appetite, inadequate or excessive motions and blood disor- ders. For this, take light, limited and timely meals only.

It is excellent to sweat after applying Karpooradi tailam. Restrict body movments. Ajirnam (indigestion) This is when food eaten is undigested due to inactive digestive fire. Starve till all food is digested. Drink hot water boiled with dry ginger and in severe cases do Vamana with drinks of salt or mustard water and a Swedana. After this, follow Peyadikrama and take medicines as for dyspepsia. In minor cases, Dravakas and Ksharas as for dyspepsia will work. Atisaram (Diarrhoea) This is purging without taking purgatives.
